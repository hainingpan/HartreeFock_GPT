"We are interested in solving the self-consistency equation for Hartree-Fock mean-field theory on a 2D triangular lattice associated with the following  mean-field Hamiltonian $H = H_{\text{Kinetic}} + H_{\text{Hartree}} +H_{\text{Fock}}$, with $H_{\text{Kinetic}} = \sum_{s, k} E_s(k) c^\dagger_s(k) c_s(k)$, where $E_s(k)=\sum_{n} t_s(n) e^{-i k \cdot n}$ with the spin index $s = \{\uparrow, \downarrow\}$ and momentum $k$. The mean-field terms are $H_{\text{Hartree}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{s, s'} \sum_{k_1, k_2} U(0) \langle c_s^\dagger(k_1) c_s(k_1) \rangle c_{s'}^\dagger(k_2) c_{s'}(k_2)$ $H_{\text{Fock}} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{s, s'} \sum_{k_1, k_2} U(k_1 - k_2) \langle c_s^\dagger(k_1) c_{s'}(k_1) \rangle c_{s'}^\dagger(k_2) c_s(k_2)$, where $U(k) = \sum_{n} U_n e^{-i k \cdot n}$ is the interaction strength in the momentum basis. What would be the dimension of the matrix associated with each momentum $k$ that should be diagonalized, if you are to numerically solve the self-consistency equation?
","2 $\times$ 2 matrix.
","The matrix dimension is 2 $\times$ 2 because we have two spin states ($\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$) and the Hamiltonian is expressed in a matrix form that couples these two states.

What are the possible order parameters that preserve translational symmetry for a Hartree-Fock mean-field Hamiltonian on a two-dimensional triangular lattice?
","$\langle c^\dagger_{s}(k) c_{s}(k) \rangle$ with $s=\uparrow,\downarrow$.
","The order parameter $\langle c^\dagger_{s}(k) c_{s}(k) \rangle$ corresponds to the Ferromagnetic order parameter, which does not break the translational symmetry of the system.

"What is the kinetic term of the Hamiltonian in second-quantized form for a triangular lattice system with spin states associated with +K and -K valleys?
Consider a triangular lattice system where the degrees of freedom are spin states associated with +K and -K valleys. In this system, electrons can hop between sites with amplitude $t_s(R_i - R_j)$. The spin states $s = \uparrow,\downarrow$ represent states associated with +K and -K valleys, respectively. Each site in the triangular lattice is located at position $R_i$. The electron annihilation operator at site with position $R_i$ with spin $s$ is denoted by $c_{R_i,s}$, while the electron creation operator at the same site with the same spin is denoted by $c^{\dagger}_{R_i,s}$. The hopping process occurs between sites at positions $R_i$ and $R_j$. Derive the complete tight-binding Hamiltonian $H_{TB}$ for this system, clearly showing all summations and indices. The summation should be taken over all spin states and all real space positions.

Consider a triangular lattice system with spin degrees of freedom associated with $+K$ and $-K$ valleys.
