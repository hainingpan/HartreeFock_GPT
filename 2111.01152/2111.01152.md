# Hamiltonian construction

## Construct Kinetic Hamiltonian

**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to describe the kinetic term of Hamiltonian in the hole-doped AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 in the real space in the single-particle form.   
The degrees of freedom of the system are: valley index (+K and -K valley), layer index (top and bottom layer). 
Express the Kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{Kinetic}(r)$ using $E_{\tau,l}$ which are only on the diagonal terms, and arrange the basis in the order of (+K,bottom), (+K,top), (-K,bottom), (-K,top).

Use the following conventions for the symbols:  
$l$ : layer index   
$t$ : top layer  
$b$ : bottom layer  
$\tau$ : valley index  
$+K$ : +K valley  
$-K$ : -K valley  
$k$ : momentum operator  
$E_{l,\tau}$ : energy dispersion for layer $l$ and valley $\tau$   

**Completion:**  
Given the degrees of freedom and the symbols defined, the kinetic Hamiltonian for a single particle in real space can be expressed as a 4x4 diagonal matrix:

$$H_{Kinetic}(r) = \begin{bmatrix}
E_{b,+K} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & E_{t,+K} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & E_{b,-K} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & E_{t,-K}
\end{bmatrix}$$

This Hamiltonian describes the energy of a single particle in the system, where the diagonal elements represent the energy dispersion for each combination of layer and valley index. For instance, $E_{b,+K}$ corresponds to the energy of a particle in the +K valley of the bottom layer, while $E_{t,-K}$ refers to the energy of a particle in the -K valley of the top layer. The off-diagonal elements are zero, reflecting the fact that these terms would involve transitions between different layers or valleys, which are not part of the kinetic energy term.

## Define each term in Kinetic Hamiltonian
**Prompt:**  
Now you will be instructed to construct each term in the matrix, namely the energy dispersion $E_{l,\tau}(k)$.  
For all energy dispersions, $E_{l,\tau}(k)$, it characterizes the dispersion for free holes, namely, $E_{l,\tau}(k)= -\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m_l}$.   
In addition, for the top layer, $E_{\tau,t}(k)$, there is a shift of momentum $k$, to make the band bottom at $\tilde{\tau}\kappa$.  
Finally, in the real space, the momentum $k=-i \partial_r$. You should keep the form of $k$ in the Hamiltonian for short notations but should remember $k$ is an operator.  
Return the expression for four $E_{l,\tau}(k)$ in the Kinetic Hamiltonian, and substitute it into the Kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{Kinetic}$  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$k$ : momentum operator  
$r$ : real space operator  
$m_l$ : the effective mass for layer $l$  
$\tilde{\tau}$ : takes value of +1 for $\tau=+K$ and -1 for $\tau=-K$  
$\pm\kappa$ : corners of monolayer moire Brillouin zone  

**Completion:** 

Using the provided definitions and conventions, the energy dispersions $E_{l,\tau}(k)$ are expressed as follows:

1. For the bottom layer:
    * $E_{b,+K}(k) = -\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m_b}$
    * $E_{b,-K}(k) = -\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m_b}$

2. For the top layer, accounting for the shift of momentum:
    * $E_{t,+K}(k) = -\frac{\hbar^2 (k - \kappa)^2}{2 m_t}$
    * $E_{t,-K}(k) = -\frac{\hbar^2 (k + \kappa)^2}{2 m_t}$

where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $k$ is the momentum operator, $m_{t}$ and $m_{b}$ are the effective masses of holes in the top and bottom layers respectively, $\tilde{\tau}$ is the valley index, and $\kappa$ is the corner of the monolayer moire Brillouin zone. 

Substituting these terms into the Hamiltonian, we get:

$$H_{Kinetic}(r) = \begin{bmatrix}
-\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m_b} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -\frac{\hbar^2 (k - \kappa)^2}{2 m_t} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m_b} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{\hbar^2 (k + \kappa)^2}{2 m_t}
\end{bmatrix}$$

## Construct Potential Hamiltonian
**Prompt:**  
Now you will be instructed to describe the potential term of Hamiltonian $H_{Potential}(r)$ in the real space in the single particle form.  
The potential Hamiltonian has the same degrees of freedom as the kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{Kinetic}(r)$.  
At each valley, it is a 2 by 2 matrix $H_{Potential,\tau}(r)$, where each component is layer index. The diagonal term in this 2 by 2 matrix $H_{Potential,\tau}(r)$ is  intralayer tunneling $\Delta_l(r)$. The off-diagonal term in this 2 by 2 matrix $H_{Potential,\tau}(r)$ is interlayer potential $\Delta_{T,\tau}(r)$, which should be kept hermitian.  
There is no hybridization between $+K$ valley and $-K$ valley, i.e., the corresponding matrix elements in $H_{Potential}(r)$ are all zero.  
Express the potential Hamiltonian $H_{Potential}(r)$ using $\Delta_l(r)$ and $\Delta_{T,\tau}(r)$.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also remember the conventions in my previous prompts if there are no conflicts. If you have conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$\Delta_l$: intralayer potential for layer index $l$  
$\Delta_{T,\tau}$ : interlayer tunneling at valley index $\tau$  
$H_{Potential}(r)$ : potential term of Hamiltonian in the real space in the single-particle form.  

**Completion:**  
The potential Hamiltonian $H_{Potential}(r)$ has the same degrees of freedom as the kinetic Hamiltonian, i.e., layer index and valley index. For each valley $\tau$, it can be represented as a 2 by 2 matrix $H_{Potential,\tau}(r)$ for each layer index.

So, for the +K valley, the matrix would look like:

$$H_{Potential,+K}(r) = \begin{bmatrix}
\Delta_{b}(r) & \Delta_{T,+K}(r) \\
\Delta_{T,+K}^*(r) & \Delta_{t}(r)
\end{bmatrix}$$

And for the -K valley:

$$H_{Potential,-K}(r) = \begin{bmatrix}
\Delta_{b}(r) & \Delta_{T,-K}(r) \\
\Delta_{T,-K}^*(r) & \Delta_{t}(r)
\end{bmatrix}$$

Where $\Delta_{b}(r)$ and $\Delta_{t}(r)$ are intralayer potentials for bottom and top layers, and $\Delta_{T,\tau}(r)$ is the interlayer tunneling at valley $\tau$. 

Given there is no hybridization between the +K and -K valleys, the full potential Hamiltonian can be written as a 4 by 4 block-diagonal matrix, with $H_{Potential,+K}(r)$ and $H_{Potential,-K}(r)$ as its diagonal blocks:

$$H_{Potential}(r) = \begin{bmatrix}
H_{Potential,+K}(r) & 0 \\
0 & H_{Potential,-K}(r)
\end{bmatrix}$$

With $H_{Potential,+K}(r)$ and $H_{Potential,-K}(r)$ substituted in, the explicit form is:

$$H_{Potential}(r) = \begin{bmatrix}
\Delta_{b}(r) & \Delta_{T,+K}(r) & 0 & 0 \\
\Delta_{T,+K}^*(r) & \Delta_{t}(r) & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \Delta_{b}(r) & \Delta_{T,-K}(r) \\
0 & 0 & \Delta_{T,-K}^*(r) & \Delta_{t}(r)
\end{bmatrix}$$

## Define each term in Potential Hamiltonian
**Prompt:**  
Now you will be instructed to construct each term in the matrix $H_{Potential}(r)$, namely, the intralayer potential $\Delta_l(r)$ and interlayer tunneling $\Delta_{T,\tau}(r)$.  
The intralayer on the top layer $\Delta_t(r)$ is $V_{zt}$.  
The intralayer on the bottom layer $\Delta_b(r)$ is $ 2V_b\sum_{j=1,3,5} \cos(g_j \cdot r  +\psi_b)$.  
The interlayer tunneling at valley $\tau$ is $\tilde{\tau}w(1+\omega^{\tilde{\tau}}e^{i\tilde{\tau} g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{2\tilde{\tau}} e^{i\tilde{\tau} g_3 \cdot r})$.  
Return the expressions for the intralayer potential $\Delta_t(r)$ and $\Delta_b(r)$ and interlayer tunneling $\Delta_{T,+K}(r)$ and $\Delta_{T,-K}(r)$, and substitute it into the potential Hamiltonian $H_{Potential}(r)$.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or have conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$V_{zt}$ : displacement field on the top layer  
$V_b$ : bottom layer potential strength  
$\psi_b$ : bottom layer potential phase  
$g_j$ : reciprocal unit vector on the first shell corresponding in the moire Brillouin zone, j varies from 1 to 6.  
$r$ : real space position  
$\omega$ : phase factor to respect the threefold rotational symmetry, which is $\exp(i2\pi/3)$, the hermitian conjugate is $\omega^{-1}=\exp(i2\pi/3)$  
$w$ : interlayer tunneling strength  

**Completion:**  
Following your instructions, the intralayer potentials for top and bottom layers, $\Delta_t(r)$ and $\Delta_b(r)$, and the interlayer tunneling at valley $\tau$, $\Delta_{T,\tau}(r)$, are:

1. Intralayer potential for the top layer:
    * $$\Delta_t(r) = V_{zt}$$

2. Intralayer potential for the bottom layer:
    * $$\Delta_b(r) = 2V_b \sum_{j=1,3,5} \cos(g_j \cdot r  +\psi_b)$$

3. Interlayer tunneling at valley +K:
    * $$\Delta_{T,+K}(r) = w (1+\omega e^{i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{2} e^{i g_3 \cdot r})$$

4. Interlayer tunneling at valley -K:
    * $$\Delta_{T,-K}(r) = -w (1+\omega^{-1} e^{-i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{-2} e^{-i g_3 \cdot r})$$

By substituting these terms into the potential Hamiltonian, we get:

$$H_{Potential}(r) = \begin{bmatrix}
2V_b \sum_{j=1,3,5} \cos(g_j \cdot r  +\psi_b) & w (1+\omega e^{i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{2} e^{i g_3 \cdot r}) & 0 & 0 \\
w (1+\omega e^{-i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{2} e^{-i g_3 \cdot r}) & V_{zt} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 2V_b \sum_{j=1,3,5} \cos(g_j \cdot r  +\psi_b) & -w (1+\omega^{-1} e^{-i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{-2} e^{-i g_3 \cdot r}) \\
0 & 0 & -w (1+\omega e^{i g_2 \cdot r} + \omega^{2} e^{i g_3 \cdot r}) & V_{zt}
\end{bmatrix}$$


## Convert from single-particle to second-quantized form, return in the matrix
**Prompt:**  
Now you will be instructed to construct the second quantized form of the total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the real space.  
The noninteracting Hamiltonian in the real space $H^{0}$ is the sum of Kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{Kinetic}(r)$ and Potential Hamiltonian $H_{Potential}(r)$.  
To construct the second quantized form of a Hamiltonian. You should construct the creation and annihilation operators from the basis explicitly. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to convert a Hamiltonian from the single-particle form to second-quantized form.  
Finally by "total", it means you need to take a summation over the real space position $r$.   
Return the second quantized form of the total noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H^{0}}$  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$\psi_{\tau,l}(r)$ : electron annihilation operator at valley index $\tau$ and layer index $l$  
$\vec{\psi}(r)$ : spinor containing all annihilation operators $\psi_{\tau,l}(r)$ following the same order of $H^{0}$  
$H^{0}(r)$ : single-particle noninteracting Hamiltonian in the real space  
$\hat{H^{0}}$ : total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the second quantized form  

===  
EXAMPLE:  
For a Hamiltonian $H$, where $H=\begin{pmatrix} H_{a,a} & H_{a,b} \\ H_{b,a} & H_{b,b} \end{pmatrix}$ and the order of basis is (a), (b), we can construct the creation operators $\psi_a^\dagger$  and $\psi_b^\dagger$, and the annihilation operator $\psi_a$  and $\psi_b$.  
The corresponding second quantized form is $\hat{H}=\vec{\psi}^\dagger H \vec{\psi}$, where $\vec{\psi}=\begin{pmatrix} \psi_a \\ \psi_b \end{pmatrix}$ and $\vec{\psi}^\dagger=\begin{pmatrix} \psi_a^\dagger & \psi_b^\dagger \end{pmatrix}$.  

**Completion:**  
Following the convention, the annihilation operators for the four states are ordered as follows: 
$$\vec{\psi}(r) = \begin{pmatrix} \psi_{+K,b}(r) \\ \psi_{+K,t}(r) \\ \psi_{-K,b}(r) \\ \psi_{-K,t}(r) \end{pmatrix}$$

The conjugate transpose (or the adjoint) of this operator gives us the creation operators:
$$\vec{\psi}^\dagger(r) = \begin{pmatrix} \psi_{+K,b}^\dagger(r) & \psi_{+K,t}^\dagger(r) & \psi_{-K,b}^\dagger(r) & \psi_{-K,t}^\dagger(r) \end{pmatrix}$$

The noninteracting Hamiltonian in real space, $H^{0}(r)$, is the sum of the kinetic and potential Hamiltonians, i.e., $H^{0}(r) = H_{Kinetic}(r) + H_{Potential}(r)$.

Given that, the second quantized form of the total noninteracting Hamiltonian can be written as:
$$\hat{H^{0}} = \int dr \vec{\psi}^\dagger(r) H^{0}(r) \vec{\psi}(r)$$

Therefore, the second quantized form of the total noninteracting Hamiltonian is the spatial integral over the matrix element of the Hamiltonian, sandwiched between the creation and annihilation operators.

## Convert from single-particle to second-quantized form, return in summation (expand the matrix)
**Prompt:**  
Now you will be instructed to expand the second-quantized form Hamiltonian $\hat{H^{0}}$ using $H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r)$ and $\psi_{\tau,l}(r)$. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to expand the Hamiltonian.  
You should use any previous knowledge to simplify it. For example, if any term of $H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r)$ is zero, you should remove it from the summation.  
Return the expanded form of $\hat{H^{0}}$ after simplication.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r)$ : the matrix element of single-particle noninteracting Hamiltonian in the real space  

===  
EXAMPLE:  
For a $\hat{H}=\vec{\psi}^\dagger H \vec{\psi}$, where $\vec{\psi}=\begin{pmatrix} \psi_a \\ \psi_b \end{pmatrix}$ and $\vec{\psi}^\dagger=\begin{pmatrix} \psi_a^\dagger & \psi_b^\dagger \end{pmatrix}$, we can expand it as  $\hat{H}=\sum_{i,j=\{a,b\}} \psi_i^\dagger H_{i,j} \psi_j$.  

**Completion:**  
The total noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H^{0}}$ is given by

$\hat{H^{0}} = \int dr \vec{\psi}^\dagger(r) H^{0}(r) \vec{\psi}(r)$

We expand this expression as:

$\hat{H^{0}} = \int dr \sum_{\tau_1, l_1, \tau_2, l_2} \psi_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(r) H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r) \psi_{\tau_2,l_2}(r)$

However, because there is no hybridization between the +K and -K valleys, i.e., $H^{0}_{\tau_1,l_1,\tau_2,l_2}(r) = 0$ when $\tau_1 \neq \tau_2$, we can simplify the expression as:

$\hat{H^{0}} = \int dr \sum_{l_1, l_2} \left( \psi_{+K,l_1}^\dagger(r) H^{0}_{+K,l_1,+K,l_2}(r) \psi_{+K,l_2}(r) + \psi_{-K,l_1}^\dagger(r) H^{0}_{-K,l_1,-K,l_2}(r) \psi_{-K,l_2}(r) \right)$

Now, we sum over layer indices $l_1$ and $l_2$ for each valley index.

## Convert Hamiltonian in real space to momentum space (continuum version)
**Prompt:**  
Now you will be instructed to convert the total noninteracting Hamiltonian in the second quantized form from the basis in real space to the basis by momentum space.  
To do that, you should apply the Fourier transformation to $\psi_{\tau,l}(r)$ in the real space to the $c_{\tau,l}^\dagger(k)$ in the momentum space, which is defined as $c_{\tau,l}^\dagger(k)= \frac{1}{\sqrt{NV}} \int dr \psi_{\tau,l}^\dagger(r) e^{i k \cdot r}$, where $r$ is integrated over the entire real space. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to apply the Fourier transformation.  
Express the total noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H^{0}}$ in terms of $c_{\tau,l}(k)$ and $c_{\tau,l}^\dagger(k)$. Simplify any summation index if possible.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$c_{l,\tau}(k)$ : electron annihilation operator at momentum $k$, layer $l$, and valley $\tau$  
$c_{l,\tau}^\dagger(k)$ : electron creation operator at momentum $k$, layer $l$, and valley $\tau$  
$N$ : number of the unit cells in the real space  
$V$ : area of unit cell in the real space  
$\Omega$ : area of Brillouin zone in the momentum space  

===  
EXAMPLE:  
Write a Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ in the second quantized form, $\hat{H}=\int dr \psi(r)^\dagger H(r) \psi(r)$, where $r$ is integrated over the entire real space.  
Define the Fourier transformation $c^\dagger(k)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N V}} \int \psi^\dagger(r) e^{i k \cdot r} dr$, where $r$ is integrated over the entire real space, $N$ is the number of unit cells, and $V$ is the area of the unit cell in the real space.  
This leads to the inverse Fourier transformation $\psi^\dagger(r) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N \Omega}} \sum_k c^\dagger(k) e^{-i k \cdot r}$, where $k$ is summed over the extended Brillouin zone (i.e., the entire momentum space), $\Omega$ is the area of Brillouin zone in the momentum space.  
Thus, substitute $\psi^\dagger(r)$ and $\psi(r)$ into $\hat{H}$, we get  
$$\hat{H} = \int dr \frac{1}{\sqrt{N \Omega}} \sum_{k_1} c^\dagger(k_1) e^{-i k_1 \cdot r} H(r) \frac{1}{\sqrt{N \Omega}} \sum_{k_2} c(k_2) e^{i k_2 \cdot r} =\sum_{k_1,k_2} c^\dagger(k_1) \frac{1}{N\Omega} \int dr e^{-i (k_1-k_2)\cdot r} H(r) c(k_2) = \sum_{k_1,k_2} c^\dagger(k_1) H(k_1,k_2) c(k_2)$$  
, where we define the Fourier transformation of $H(r)$ as $H(k_1,k_2)=\frac{1}{N\Omega} \int dr e^{-i (k_1-k_2)\cdot r} H(r)$.

**Completion:**  
To convert the total noninteracting Hamiltonian from real space to momentum space, we first substitute the Fourier transformations of the field operators $\psi_{\tau, l}(r)$ and $\psi_{\tau, l}^\dagger(r)$ into the expression for $\hat{H^{0}}$.

The Fourier transformations are defined as follows:

$$c_{\tau, l}(k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{NV}} \int dr \psi_{\tau, l}(r) e^{-i k \cdot r}$$

$$c_{\tau, l}^\dagger(k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{NV}} \int dr \psi_{\tau, l}^\dagger(r) e^{i k \cdot r}$$

The total noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H^{0}}$ then becomes:

$$\hat{H^{0}} = \int dr \sum_{\tau, l_1, l_2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{NV}} \sum_{k_1} c_{\tau, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) e^{-i k_1 \cdot r} H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_2}(r) \frac{1}{\sqrt{NV}} \sum_{k_2} c_{\tau, l_2}(k_2) e^{i k_2 \cdot r}$$

We can then perform the Fourier transformation on $H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_2}(r)$:

$$H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_2}(k_1, k_2) = \frac{1}{N \Omega} \int dr e^{-i (k_1 - k_2) \cdot r} H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_2}(r)$$

We finally obtain the expression for $\hat{H^{0}}$ in momentum space:

$$\hat{H^{0}} = \sum_{\tau, l_1, l_2, k_1, k_2} c_{\tau, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_2}(k_1, k_2) c_{\tau, l_2}(k_2)$$

In the summation, $k_1$ and $k_2$ are summed over the entire Brillouin zone, and $l_1$ and $l_2$ are summed over all layers. $\tau$ is summed over the valley indices. Note that there is no hybridization between +K and -K valleys, which means that the summation of $\tau$ could be separately done for each valley, +K and -K.



## Apply Particle-hole transformation
**Prompt:**  
Now you will be instructed to perform a particle-hole transformation.  
Define a hole operator, $b_{l,\tau}(k)$, which equals $c_{l,\tau}^\dagger(k)$.  
You should replace $c_{l,\tau}$ with $b_{l,\tau}(k)^\dagger$, and $c_{l,\tau}^\dagger$ with $b_{l,\tau}(k)$. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to apply the particle-hole transformation.
Return the $\hat{H^{0}}$ in the hole operators.

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$b_{l,\tau}(k)$ : hole annihilation operator at momentum $k$, layer $l$, and valley $\tau$

===  
EXAMPLE:  
Give a Hamiltonian  $\hat{H}=\sum_{k_1,k_2} c^\dagger(k_1) h(k_1,k_2) c(k_2)$ , and the particle-hole transformation as $b(k)=c^\dagger(k)$. The transformed Hamiltonian is $\hat{H}=\sum_{k_1,k_2} b(k_1) h(k_1,k_2) b^\dagger(k_2)$ 


**Completion:**  
Following the example and the definition of the hole operator, we can perform the particle-hole transformation on the total noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H^{0}}$. We substitute $b_{\tau, l}(k) = c_{\tau, l}^\dagger(k)$ into the expression for $\hat{H^{0}}$.

The resulting Hamiltonian is then:

$\hat{H^{0}} = \sum_{\tau, l_1, l_2, k_1, k_2} b_{\tau, l_1}(k_1) H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_2}(k_1, k_2) b_{\tau, l_2}^\dagger(k_2)$

In this expression, $k_1$ and $k_2$ are summed over the entire Brillouin zone, $l_1$ and $l_2$ are summed over all layers, and $\tau$ is summed over the valley indices.


## Simplify the Hamiltonian in the particle-hole basis
**Prompt:**  
Now you will be instructed to simplify the $\hat{H^{0}}$ in the hole basis.  
You should use canonical commutator relation for fermions to reorder the hole operator to the normal order. Normal order means that creation operators always appear before the annihilation operators.  You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it to the normal order.  
Express the $\hat{H^{0}}$ in the normal order of $b_{l,\tau}(k)$ and also make $l_1$/$k_1$ always appear before $l_2$/$k_2$ in the index of $b$ and $H$.  
You should call this final version as $\hat{H}^{0,final}$ and remember it.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$\delta_{i,j}$ : Kronecker delta function, take the value of 1 if $i=j$, and 0 otherwise.  
$[b_i, b_j]_{+}$ : anticommuting relation, i.e., $[b_i, b_j]_+= b_i b_j +b_j b_i$  
$\hat{H}^{0,final}$ : the final version of noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H^{0}}$ in the hole basis after simplification.  

===
EXAMPLE:  
For $\hat{H^{0}}= \sum_{i,j} b_i H_{i,j} b_j^\dagger$, where $b_i$ satisfies fermion statistics (anticommuting to its self-adjoint operator).  
This gives $[b_i, b_j^\dagger]_{+} = \delta_{i,j}$, which means $b_i b_j^\dagger=\delta_{i,j}-b_j^\dagger b_i$.  
Substitute it into $\hat{H^{0}}$, we have $\hat{H^{0}}=\sum_{i,j} (\delta_{i,j}-b_j^\dagger b_i) H_{i,j}=\sum_{i,j} \delta_{i,j} H_{i,j} - \sum_{i,j}b_j^\dagger b_i H_{i,j}=\sum_i H_{i,i} - \sum_{i,j}b_j^\dagger b_i H_{i,j}$.  
The first term is simply $\sum_i H_{i,i}$ by summing over the index $j$ due to $\delta_{i,j}$.
The second term is $-\sum_{i,j}b_j^\dagger b_i H_{i,j}$.  
Relabeling the index of $i$ and $j$ by swapping them to make it consistent with the original order of index (namely, $i$ appears before $j$ in the index of $b$ and $H$), it becomes $-\sum_{i,j}b_i^\dagger H_{j,i} b_j$.
Finally, to fix the order of the index in $H$ such that $i$ appears before $j$, we notice that $H_{j,i}=(H_{i,j})^*$, where $^*$ means complex conjugate, because the Hamiltonian is Hermitian.  
Thus, we end up in $\hat{H^{0}}=\sum_{i,j} b_i H_{i,j} b_j^\dagger=\sum_i H_{i,i}-\sum_{i,j}b_i^\dagger (H_{i,j})^* b_j$

**Completion:**  
Following the example provided, we can simplify the total noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H^{0}}$ in the hole basis using the anticommutator relation $[b_{\tau,l}(k), b_{\tau,l'}^\dagger(k')]_+ = \delta_{l,l'} \delta_{k,k'}$ where the Kronecker delta function $\delta_{l,l'}$ takes the value 1 if $l=l'$ and 0 otherwise, and similarly for $\delta_{k,k'}$.

We have:

$$\hat{H^{0}} = \sum_{\tau, l_1, l_2, k_1, k_2} b_{\tau, l_1}(k_1) H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_2}(k_1, k_2) b_{\tau, l_2}^\dagger(k_2)$$

Applying the anticommutator relation gives:

$$\hat{H^{0}} = \sum_{\tau, l_1, l_2, k_1, k_2} (\delta_{l_1,l_2}\delta_{k_1,k_2}-b_{\tau, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau, l_1}(k_1)) H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_2}(k_1, k_2)$$

Then, we simplify the above expression by performing the summations over $l_2$ and $k_2$ on the term containing the Kronecker deltas and relabeling the indices. We also replace $H^{0}_{\tau, l_2, \tau, l_1}(k_2, k_1)$ by its complex conjugate $(H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_2}(k_1, k_2))^*$ because the Hamiltonian is Hermitian. We obtain:

$$\hat{H^{0}} = \sum_{\tau, l_1, k_1} H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_1}(k_1, k_1) - \sum_{\tau, l_1, l_2, k_1, k_2} b_{\tau, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) (H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_2}(k_1, k_2))^* b_{\tau, l_2}(k_2)$$

This is the final version of the noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H^{0}}$ in the hole basis, denoted by $\hat{H}^{0,final}$:

$$\hat{H}^{0,final} = \sum_{\tau, l_1, k_1} H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_1}(k_1, k_1) - \sum_{\tau, l_1, l_2, k_1, k_2} b_{\tau, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) (H^{0}_{\tau, l_1, \tau, l_2}(k_1, k_2))^* b_{\tau, l_2}(k_2)$$

## Construct interaction Hamiltonian
**Prompt:**  
Now you will be instructed to construct the interaction part of the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{int}$ in the momentum space.  
The interaction Hamiltonian is a product of four parts.
The first part is the product of four operators with two creation and two annihilation operators following the normal order, namely, creation operators are before annihilation operators. The order of valley index $\tau_i$ is 1,2,2,1. The order of layer index $l_i$ is 1,2,2,1. The order of the momentum $k_i$ is 1,2,3,4.
The second part is the constraint of total momentum conservation, namely the total momentum of all creation operators should be the same as that of all annihilation operators.  
The third part is the interaction form. You should use the dual-gate-screened Coulomb interaction $V(q)=2\pi e^2\tanh(|q| d)/(\epsilon |q|)$, where $q$ is the transferred total momentum between a creation operator and an annihilation operator of the same spin and layer, namely $q=k_1-k_4$ .   
The fourth part is the normalization factor, you should use $\frac{1}{2 N V}$ here.
Finally, the summation should be running over all layer index, valley index, and momentum.
Return the interaction term $\hat{H}^{int}$ in terms of $b_{l,\tau}(k)$ and $V(q)$ (with $q$ expressed in terms of $k_i$ and $b_i$).

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$d$ : distance between dual gates  
$\epsilon$ : dielectric constant  
$V(q)$ : dual-gate-screened Coulomb interaction in the momentum space

**Completion:**  
The interaction Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{int}$ can be written as a sum over all momenta, valleys, and layers. It includes four operator terms (two creation operators and two annihilation operators), the interaction form $V(q)$, the constraint of total momentum conservation, and a normalization factor. 

Considering the normalization factor $\frac{1}{2 N V}$ and following the order of $1,2,2,1$ for the indices and $k_1$ to $k_4$ for the momenta, we have:

$\hat{H}^{int} = \frac{1}{2 N V} \sum_{l_1, l_2, \tau_1, \tau_2} \sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) V(q) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4)$

The interaction form is given by the dual-gate-screened Coulomb interaction, $V(q)=\frac{2\pi e^2\tanh(|q| d)}{\epsilon |q|}$, where $q$ is the momentum difference between the creation and annihilation operators of the same type of spin and layer. Specifically, we can express $q$ in terms of the creation and annihilation momenta: $q = k_1 - k_4 = k_2 - k_3$. Hence,

$\hat{H}^{int} = \frac{1}{2 N V} \sum_{l_1, l_2, \tau_1, \tau_2} \sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) \frac{2\pi e^2\tanh(|k_1 - k_4| d)}{\epsilon |k_1 - k_4|} b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4)$

The constraint of total momentum conservation is reflected by the delta function: $\delta_{k_1 + k_2, k_3 + k_4}$.

Therefore, the final form of the interaction Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{int}$ becomes:

$\hat{H}^{int} = \frac{1}{2 N V} \sum_{l_1, l_2, \tau_1, \tau_2} \sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} \delta_{k_1 + k_2, k_3 + k_4} b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) \frac{2\pi e^2\tanh(|k_1 - k_4| d)}{\epsilon |k_1 - k_4|} b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4)$

# Hartree-Fock approximation
## Wick’s theorem
**Prompt:**  
Now You will be instructed to perform a Hartree-Fock approximation to expand the interaction term $\hat{H}^{int}$.  
You should use Wick's theorem to expand the four-fermion term in $\hat{H}^{int}$ into quadratic terms. You should strictly follow the EXAMPLE below to expand using Wick's theorem, and be extremely cautious about the order of the index and sign before each term.  
You should only preserve the normal terms. Here, the normal terms mean the product of a creation operator and an annihilation operator.  
Return the expanded interaction term after Hartree-Fock approximation $\hat{H}^{int,HF}$.

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$\langle b_{l_1,\tau_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{l_2,\tau_2}(k_2) \rangle$ : expectation of $b_{l_1,\tau_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{l_2,\tau_2}(k_2)$ over the many-body ground states.  
$\hat{H}^{int,HF}$ : Interaction term after Hartree-Fock approximation  

===
EXAMPLE:  
For a four-fermion term $a_1^\dagger a_2^\dagger a_3 a_4$, using Wick's theorem and preserving only the normal terms. this is expanded as $a_1^\dagger a_2^\dagger a_3 a_4 = \langle a_1^\dagger a_4 \rangle a_2^\dagger a_3 + \langle a_2^\dagger a_3 \rangle a_1^\dagger a_4 - \langle a_1^\dagger a_4 \rangle \langle a_2^\dagger a_3\rangle - \langle a_1^\dagger a_3 \rangle a_2^\dagger a_4 - \langle a_2^\dagger a_4 \rangle a_1^\dagger a_3 + \langle a_1^\dagger a_3\rangle \langle a_2^\dagger a_4 \rangle$  
Be cautious about the order of the index and sign before each term here.

**Completion:**  
We can apply the Wick's theorem to the interaction Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{int}$ and only keep the normal terms. Note that the normal terms mean the product of a creation operator and an annihilation operator. Be aware of the signs and the order of indices in the following expansion:

For the four-fermion term in $\hat{H}^{int}$, $b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4)$, using Wick's theorem and preserving only the normal terms, we expand it as follows:

$b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) = \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) + \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4)- \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle - \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) - \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) + \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle$

Here $\langle b_{\tau_i, l_i}^\dagger(k_i) b_{\tau_j, l_j}(k_j) \rangle$ is the expectation of $b_{\tau_i, l_i}^\dagger(k_i) b_{\tau_j, l_j}(k_j)$ over the many-body ground states.

Therefore, the interaction term after the Hartree-Fock approximation $\hat{H}^{int,HF}$ becomes:

$\hat{H}^{int,HF} = \frac{1}{2 N V} \sum_{l_1, l_2, \tau_1, \tau_2} \sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} \delta_{k_1 + k_2, k_3 + k_4} \frac{2\pi e^2\tanh(|k_1 - k_4| d)}{\epsilon |k_1 - k_4|}[ \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3)+ \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) - \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle - \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) - \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) + \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle]$

## Extract quadratic term
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to extract the quadratic terms in the $\hat{H}^{int,HF}$.  
The quadratic terms mean terms that are proportional to $b^\dagger b$, which excludes terms that are solely expectations or products of expectations.  
You should only preserve the quadratic terms in $\hat{H}^{int,HF}$, which is called $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$.
Return this Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$.  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encountered undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):  
$\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$ : the quadratic terms in $\hat{H}^{int,HF}$

**Completion:**  
Sure, we can extract the quadratic terms from the Hartree-Fock approximated interaction Hamiltonian. The quadratic terms are the ones which contain the product of a creation operator and an annihilation operator.

From the previously expanded $\hat{H}^{int,HF}$, we only preserve the quadratic terms, which give us $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$:

$\hat{H}^{int,HF,2} = \frac{1}{2 N V} \sum_{l_1, l_2, \tau_1, \tau_2} \sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} \delta_{k_1 + k_2, k_3 + k_4} \frac{2\pi e^2\tanh(|k_1 - k_4| d)}{\epsilon |k_1 - k_4|} [ \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3)+ \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4)- \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4)- \langle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3)]$

This Hamiltonian, $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$, now only contains terms that are products of a creation operator and an annihilation operator, with coefficients involving expectations of such products.

# Simplify the MF quadratic term
## Relabel the index 
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to simplify the quadratic term $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$ through relabeling the index to combine the two Hartree/Fock term into one Hartree/Fock term.  
The logic is that the expecteted value ($\langle b_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1,l_1}(k_4) \rangle$) in the first Hartree term ($\langle b_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1,l_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_2,l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2,l_2}(k_3)$) has the same form as the qudratic operators in the second Hartree term ($\langle b_{\tau_2,l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2,l_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_1,l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1,l_1}(k_4)$), and vice versa.  
This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the "expected value" and "quadratic operators" in the second Hartree term, you can make the second Hartree term look identical to the first Hartree term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.  
You should perform this trick of "relabeling the index" for both two Hartree terms and two Fock terms to reduce them to one Hartree term, and one Fock term.   
Return the simplied $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$ which reduces from four terms (two Hartree and two Fock terms) to only two terms (one Hartree and one Fock term)

===  
EXAMPLE:
Given a Hamiltonian $\hat{H}=\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3,\sigma_4} V(k_1-k_4) (\langle c_{\sigma_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{\sigma_4}(k_4) \rangle c_{\sigma_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{\sigma_3}(k_3) + \langle c_{\sigma_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{\sigma_3}(k_3) \rangle c_{\sigma_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{\sigma_4}(k_4) ) \delta_{k_1+k_2,k_3+k_4}$, where $V(q)=V(-q)$.  
In the second term, we relabel the index to swap the index in expected value and the index in quadratic operators, namely, $\sigma_1 \leftrightarrow \sigma_2$, $\sigma_3 \leftrightarrow \sigma_4$, $k_1 \leftrightarrow k_2$, $k_3 \leftrightarrow k_4$. After the replacement, the second term becomes $\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3,\sigma_4} V(k_2-k_3) \langle c_{\sigma_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{\sigma_4}(k_4) \rangle c_{\sigma_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{\sigma_3}(k_3) \delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$.  
Note that the Kronecker dirac function $\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$ implies $k_1+k_2=k_3+k_4$, i.e., $k_2-k_3=k_4-k_1$. Thus, the second term simplifies to $\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3,\sigma_4} V(k_4-k_1) \langle c_{\sigma_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{\sigma_4}(k_4) \rangle c_{\sigma_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{\sigma_3}(k_3) \delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$.
Because $V(q)=V(-q)$, meaning $V(k_4-k_1)=V(k_1-k_4)$, the second term further simplifies to $\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3,\sigma_4} V(k_1-k_4) \langle c_{\sigma_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{\sigma_4}(k_4) \rangle c_{\sigma_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{\sigma_3}(k_3) \delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. Note that this form of second term after relabeling is identical to the first term.  
Finally, we have the simplified Hamiltonian as  $\hat{H}=2\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\sigma_3,\sigma_4} V(k_1-k_4) \langle c_{\sigma_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{\sigma_4}(k_4) \rangle c_{\sigma_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{\sigma_3}(k_3) \delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$.

**Completion:**  
In your example, by relabeling indices to swap the indices of the expected value and the indices of the quadratic operators in the second term, we can combine the two similar terms.

We will follow the same procedure with the $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$ to simplify it. For the second Hartree term, we perform the index relabeling: $(\tau_1,l_1,k_1) \leftrightarrow (\tau_2,l_2,k_2)$ and $(\tau_1,l_1,k_4) \leftrightarrow (\tau_2,l_2,k_3)$, we find the two Hartree terms can be combined. And we apply the same process for the Fock terms: $(\tau_1,l_1,k_1) \leftrightarrow (\tau_2,l_2,k_2)$ and $(\tau_2,l_2,k_3) \leftrightarrow (\tau_1,l_1,k_4)$.

Therefore, the simplified $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$ reduces to only two terms, one Hartree and one Fock term:

$\hat{H}^{int,HF,2} = \frac{1}{N V} \sum_{l_1, l_2, \tau_1, \tau_2} \sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} \delta_{k_1 + k_2, k_3 + k_4} \frac{2\pi e^2\tanh(|k_1 - k_4| d)}{\epsilon |k_1 - k_4|}[ \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3)- \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4)]$

Please note the 2 factor out front due to the combination of the two identical terms for Hartree and Fock respectively, and the signs in front of the terms remain the same as before.

## Reduce momentum in Hartree term (momentum in BZ) (Problem is I have to expand the k in terms of b1, b2 )
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to simplify the Hartree term in $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$ by reducing the momentum inside the expected value $\langle b_{\tau_i,l_i}^\dagger(k_i) b_{\tau_j,l_j}(k_j) \rangle$.  
The expected value $\langle b_{\tau_i,l_i}^\dagger(k_i) b_{\tau_j,l_j}(k_j) \rangle$ is only nonzero when the two momenta $k_i,k_j$ is the same, namely, $\langle b_{\tau_i,l_i}^\dagger(k_i) b_{\tau_j,l_j}(k_j) \rangle=\langle b_{\tau_i,l_i}^\dagger(k_i) b_{\tau_j,l_j}(k_j) \rangle \delta_{k_i,k_j}$.  
You should use the property of Kronecker delta function $\delta_{k_i,k_j}$ to reduce one momentum $k_i$ but not $\tau_i,l_i$.
Once you reduce one momentum inside the expected value $\langle\dots\rangle$. You will also notice the total momentum conservation will reduce another momentum in the quadratic term. Therefore, you should end up with only two momenta left in the summation.  
You should follow the EXAMPLE below to reduce one momentum in the Hartree term, and another momentum in the quadratic term.  
You should recall that the Hartree term in $\frac{1}{N V} \sum_{l_1, l_2, \tau_1, \tau_2} \sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} \delta_{k_1 + k_2, k_3 + k_4} V(k_1-k_4) \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4) \rangle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3)]$.  
Return the final simplified Hartree term $\hat{H}^{int,Hartree,2}$.

===  
EXAMPLE:  
Given a Hamiltonian where the Hartree term $\hat{H}^{Hartree}=\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_4) \rangle c_{b_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_3) \delta_{k_1+k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+k_4+b_3+b_4}$, where $k_i$ is the momentum inside first Brilloun zone and $b_i$ is the reciprocal lattice.   
Inside the expected value, we realize $\langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_4) \rangle$ is nonzero only when $k_1=k_4$, i.e., $\langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_4) \rangle=\langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_4) \rangle\delta_{k_1,k_4}$.  
Thus, the Hartree term becomes $\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_4) \rangle \delta_{k_1,k_4} c_{b_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_3) \delta_{k_1+k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+k_4+b_3+b_4}$.  
Use the property of Kronecker delta function $\delta_{k_1,k_4}$ to sum over $k_4$, we have $\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_1+b_1-b_4) \langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_1) \rangle c_{b_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_3) \delta_{k_1+k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+k_1+b_3+b_4}=\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(b_1-b_4) \langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_1) \rangle c_{b_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_3) \delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+b_3+b_4}$.  
Because $k_i$ is momentum inside first Brilloun zone while $b_i$ is the reciprocal lattice. It is only when $k_2=k_3$ that $\delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+b_3+b_4}$ is nonzero, i.e., $\delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+b_3+b_4}=\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}\delta_{k_2,k_3}$. Therefore, the Hartree term simplifies to $\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(b_1-b_4) \langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_1) \rangle c_{b_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_3) \delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}\delta_{k_2,k_3}=\sum_{k_1, k_2,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(b_1-b_4) \langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_1) \rangle c_{b_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_2) \delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}$.  
Therefore, the final simplified Hartree term after reducing two momenta is $\hat{H}^{Hartree}=\sum_{k_1, k_2,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4}  V(b_1-b_4) \langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_1) \rangle c_{b_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_2) \delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4} \delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}$ 


**Completion:**  

## Reduce momentum in the Fock term (momentum in BZ)
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to simplify the Fock term in $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$ by reducing the momentum inside the expected value $\langle b_{\tau_i,l_i}^\dagger(k_i) b_{\tau_j,l_j}(k_j) \rangle$.  
The expected value $\langle b_{\tau_i,l_i}^\dagger(k_i) b_{\tau_j,l_j}(k_j) \rangle$ is only nonzero when the two momenta $k_i,k_j$ is the same, namely, $\langle b_{\tau_i,l_i}^\dagger(k_i) b_{\tau_j,l_j}(k_j) \rangle=\langle b_{\tau_i,l_i}^\dagger(k_i) b_{\tau_j,l_j}(k_j) \rangle \delta_{k_i,k_j}$.  
You should use the property of Kronecker delta function $\delta_{k_i,k_j}$ to reduce one momentum $k_i$ but not $\tau_i,l_i$.  
Once you reduce one momentum inside the expected value $\langle\dots\rangle$. You will also notice the total momentum conservation will reduce another momentum in the quadratic term. Therefore, you should end up with only two momenta left in the summation.
You should follow the EXAMPLE below to reduce one momentum in the Fock term, and another momentum in the quadratic term. You should perform this method for both Hartree term and Fock term in $\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$.  
You should recall that the Fock term in $-\frac{1}{N V} \sum_{l_1, l_2, \tau_1, \tau_2} \sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} \delta_{k_1 + k_2, k_3 + k_4} V(k_1-k_4) \langle b_{\tau_1, l_1}^\dagger(k_1) b_{\tau_2, l_2}(k_3) \rangle b_{\tau_2, l_2}^\dagger(k_2) b_{\tau_1, l_1}(k_4)$.  
Return the final simplified Fock term $\hat{H}^{int,Fock,2}$.

===  
EXAMPLE:  
Given a Hamiltonian where the Fock term $\hat{H}^{Fock}=-\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_3) \rangle c_{b_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_4)  \delta_{k_1+k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+k_4+b_3+b_4}$, where $k_i$ is the momentum inside first Brilloun zone and $b_i$ is the reciprocal lattice.   
Inside the expected value, we realize $\langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_3) \rangle$ is nonzero only when $k_1=k_3$, i.e., $\langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_3) \rangle=\langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_3) \rangle\delta_{k_1,k_3}$.    
Thus, the Fock term becomes $-\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_3) \rangle \delta_{k_1,k_3} c_{b_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_4) \delta_{k_1+k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+k_4+b_3+b_4}$.  
Use the property of Kronecker delta function $\delta_{k_1,k_3}$ to sum over $k_3$, we have $-\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_1) \rangle c_{b_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_4) \delta_{k_1+k_2+b_1+b_2,k_1+k_4+b_3+b_4}=-\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_1) \rangle c_{b_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_4) \delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_4+b_3+b_4}$.  
Because $k_i$ is momentum inside first Brilloun zone while $b_i$ is the reciprocal lattice. It is only when $k_2=k_4$ that $\delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_4+b_3+b_4}$ is nonzero, i.e., $\delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_4+b_3+b_4}=\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}\delta_{k_2,k_4}$.  
Therefore, the Fock term simplifies to $-\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4}  V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_1) \rangle c_{b_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_4) \delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}\delta_{k_2,k_4}=-\sum_{k_1,k_2, b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_2+b_1-b_4) \langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_1) \rangle c_{b_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_2) \delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}$.  
Therefore, the final simplified Fock term after reducing two momenta is $\hat{H}^{Fock}=-\sum_{k_1, k_2,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4}  V(k_1-k_2+b_1-b_4) \langle c_{b_1}^\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_1) \rangle c_{b_2}^\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_2) \delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}$

**Prompt:**  
Now you will be instructed to construct the entire Hamiltonian after the Hartree-Fock approximation $\hat{H}^{HF}$.
You should first recall the final version of the noninteracting Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{0,final}$ that I asked you to remember before.
You should then combine $\hat{H}^{0,final}$ with the interacting Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{int,HF}$ after the Hartree-Fock approximation, which is the entire Hamiltonian $\hat{H}^{HF}$ after Hartree-Fock.
Return the expression for $\hat{H}^{HF}$.

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):
