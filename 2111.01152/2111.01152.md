# Preamble
**Prompt:**  
You are a physicist helping me to construct Hamiltonian step by step based on my instructions.  
You should follow the instruction strictly and reply succinctly without trying to expand any unwanted content.  
You should stop me if you find any contradictory instructions, and point them out to me.  
You will be learning background knowledge by examples if necessary.
Confirm if you understand it.  


# Hamiltonian construction

## Construct Kinetic Hamiltonian

**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to describe the kinetic term of Hamiltonian in the hole-doped AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2 in the real space in the single-particle form. 
The degrees of freedom of the system are: valley index (+K and -K valley), layer index (top and bottom layer).  
Express the Kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{Kinetic}(r)$ using $E_{\tau,l}$ which are only on the diagonal terms, and arrange the basis in the order of (+K,bottom), (+K,top), (-K,bottom), (-K,top).  

Use the following conventions for the symbols:  
$l$ : layer index  
$t$ : top layer  
$b$ : bottom layer  
$\tau$ : valley index  
$+K$ : +K valley  
$-K$ : -K valley  
$E_{\tau,l}$ : energy dispersion for valley $\tau$ and layer $l$  
$H_{Kinetic}(r)$ : kinetic term of Hamiltonian in the real space in the single-particle form  

**Completion:**  
In the basis ${(+K,bottom), (+K,top), (-K,bottom), (-K,top)}$, we have
$$
H_{\text {Kinetic }}(r)=\begin{pmatrix}
E_{+K, b} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & E_{+K, t} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & E_{-K, b} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & E_{-K, t}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

## Define each term in Kinetic Hamiltonian
**Prompt:**  
Now you will be instructed to construct each term in the matrix, namely the energy dispersion $E_{l,\tau}(k)$.  
For all energy dispersions, $E_{l,\tau}(k)$, it characterizes the dispersion for free holes, namely, $E_{l,\tau}(k)= -\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m_l}$.   
In addition, for the top layer, $E_{\tau,t}(k)$, there is a shift of momentum $k$, to make the band bottom at $\tilde{\tau}\kappa$.  
Finally, in the real space, the momentum $k=-i \partial_r$. You should keep the form of $k$ in the Hamiltonian for short notations but should remember $k$ is an operator.  
Return the expression for four $E_{l,\tau}(k)$ in the Kinetic Hamiltonian, and substitute it into the Kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{Kinetic}$  

Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encountered undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know):
$k$ : momentum operator  
$r$ : real space operator  
$m_l$ : the effective mass for layer $l$  
$\tilde{\tau}$ : takes value of +1 for $\tau=+K$ and -1 for $\tau=-K$  
$\pm\kappa$ : corners of monolayer moire Brillouin zone  

**Completion:** 
$$H_{\text {Kinetic }}(r)=\begin{pmatrix}
-\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m_b} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -\frac{\hbar^2(k-\kappa)^2}{2 m_t} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -\frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m_b} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{\hbar^2(k+\kappa)^2}{2 m_t}
\end{pmatrix}
$$
