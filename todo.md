- [x] Identify boundaries of utilizing LLM by few-shot prompting to solve HF problems. Document the successful cases as well as failed cases, especially the failed ones will form the key messages of the ppaer.
  - Mathematical derivation
- [ ] Demonstrate LLM's Capability of Knowledge : Assess the extent to which LLM can understand physics without relying on explicit examples.
- [ ] Demonstrate LLM's Capability of Generality: Evaluate the degree to which LLM can be teached with examples.
- [x] Tag the collection of papers in Zotero, and find missing genres after that. Categorize by multiple dimensions (**bold** indicates "Contained"):
  - Kinetic term ( **Continuum model** | **Lattice model**)
  - Mean field working space (**Momentum space** | Real space)
  - Wick's theorem (**Normal order** | Superconducting order | Normal and Superconducting order)
    - Normal order parameter  (**Hartree term** | Fock term | **Hartree and Fock terms**)
  - Particle statistics (**Fermion systems** | Bosonic systems )
  - Quasiparticle type (**Electron** | Parton | Slave boson)
- [x] Resolving the issue of long-term memory by saving intermediate results on file.
- [x] Bard benchmark and comparison
