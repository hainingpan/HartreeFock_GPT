- [ ] Identify boundaries of utilizing LLM by few-shot prompting to solve HF problems. Document the successful cases as well as failed cases, especially the failed ones will form the key messages of the ppaer.
- [ ] Demonstrate LLM's Capability of Knowledge : Assess the extent to which LLM can understand physics without relying on explicit examples.
- [ ] Demonstrate LLM's Capability of Generality: Evaluate the degree to which LLM can be teached with examples.
- [ ] Tag the collection of papers in Zotero, and find missing genres after that. Categorize by multiple dimensions such as:
  - Kinetic term (Continuum model vs Lattice model)
  - MF parameters (Normal vs SC, Zero momentum vs Finite momentum)
- [ ] Resolving the issue of long-term memory by saving intermediate results on file.
