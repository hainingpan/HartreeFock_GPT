## Construct Kinetic Hamiltonian (continuum version, single-particle)  
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to describe the kinetic term of Hamiltonian in AB-stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructure in the real space in the single-particle form.   
The degrees of freedom of the system are: Layer (differentiating MoTe$_2$ and WSe$_2$) and the combined spin-valley degree..  
Express the Kinetic Hamiltonian $H_T$ using $E_{+K,b}$, $E_{-K,t}$, $E_{-K,b}$, $E_{-K,t}$ which are only on the diagonal terms, and arrange the basis in the order of (+K,bottom), (+K,top), (-K,bottom), (-K,top). 

Use the following conventions for the symbols:  
$\tau=\pm 1$ represents $\pm K$ valleys, 
bottom layer ($\mathfrak{b}$) and top layer ($\mathfrak{t}$)

**Completion:**  
The kinetic term of the Hamiltonian in the real space for the AB-stacked MoTe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructure in the single-particle form can be written as a 4x4 matrix, with the basis arranged in the order of (+K,bottom), (+K,top), (-K,bottom), (-K,top). 

The Hamiltonian $H_T$ is then given by:

$H_T = \begin{pmatrix} E_{+K,\mathfrak{b}} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & E_{+K,\mathfrak{t}} & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & E_{-K,\mathfrak{b}} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & E_{-K,\mathfrak{t}} \end{pmatrix}$

Here, $E_{\tau,\mathfrak{l}}$ represents the kinetic energy of the electron in the $\tau$ valley of the $\mathfrak{l}$ layer. The diagonal terms represent the kinetic energy of the electrons in the respective valleys and layers. The off-diagonal terms are zero, indicating no kinetic coupling between different valleys and layers.
