# Hamiltonian construction
## Construct Kinetic Hamiltonian
**Prompt:**  
You will be instructed to describe the kinetic term of Hamiltonian in {system} in the real space in the second-quantized form.   
The degrees of freedom of the system are: spin index (spin up and spin down), orbital index ($d$ orbital in Cu atom, $p_x$ orbital in O atom, and $p_y$ orbital in O atom) 
Express the Kinetic Hamiltonian {symbol} using {var} which are only on the diagonal terms, and arrange the basis in the order of {order}.

Use the following conventions for the symbols:  
$s$ : spin index  
$\uparrow$ : spin up  
$\downarrow$ : spin down 
$\alpha$ : orbital index
$d$: $d$ orbital in Cu atom
$p_x$: $p_x$ orbital in O atom
$p_y$: $p_y$ orbital in O atom



**Completion:**
