[..] means optional sentence. You should decide whether to use it depending on the excerpt.

Template:
 You will be instructed to describe the kinetic term of Hamiltonian in {system} in the {real|momentum} space in the {single-particle|second-quantized} form.   
The degrees of freedom of the system are: {degrees_of_freedom}     
The kinetic term is a tight-binding model composed of the following hopping process: 
{site i and site j with the amplitude hopping}
[You should ensure the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian]
The summation should be taken over all {degrees_of_freedom} and all {real|momentum} space positions.  
Return the Kinetic Hamiltonian {kinetic_symbol}.

 Excerpt:
 	\begin{equation}\label{eq:tb}
	H_{\text{TB}}=\sum_{s}\sum_{i,j}^{} t_{s}\left(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j\right) c_{i,s}^\dagger c_{j,s},
	\end{equation}
	where $ s= \uparrow,\downarrow\ $ represents spin $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ states associated respectively with $ +K $ and $-K$ valleys, $ \bm{R}_i $ represents a site in the triangular lattice, and $ c_{j,s} $ ($ c_{j,s}^\dagger $) is  electron annihilation (creation) operator. $t_{s}\left(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j\right)$ is the hopping parameter, which is constrained by the following relations. (1) Hermiticity of Hamiltonian~\eqref{eq:tb} requires that $  t_{s}\left(\bm{R}\right)= t_{s}^*\left(-\bm{R}\right)  $; (2) threefold rotational symmetry ($ C_3 $) requires that $  t_{s}\left(\bm{R}\right) =  t_{s}\left(\hat{\mathcal{R}}(2\pi/3)\bm{R}\right)  $, where $ \hat{\mathcal{R}}(2\pi/3) $ is a $2\pi/3$ rotation matrix; (3) time-reversal symmetry ($ \mathcal{T} $) requires that $  t_{s}\left(\bm{R}\right)= t_{-s}^*\left(\bm{R}\right) $. In Fig.~\ref{fig:lattice}, we use $ \abs{t_n} $ and $ \phi_{n}^{\uparrow} $ to denote the magnitude and phase for {\it representative} hopping parameters between $n$-th nearest neighbors in the spin $\uparrow$ channel. Since all the hopping terms within the $n$-th hopping shell are related by the aforementioned three relations, they can be determined once $ \abs{t_n} $ and $ \phi_{n}^{\uparrow} $ are determined.
	\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:hubbard}
	H&=&\sum_{s}\sum_{i,j}^{} t_{s}\left(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j\right) c_{i,s}^\dagger c_{j,s}\nonumber\\
	&+&\frac{1}{2}\sum_{s,s'}\sum_{i,j}U(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j) c_{i,s}^\dagger c_{j,s'}^\dagger c_{j,s'} c_{i,s},
	\end{eqnarray}
	where the repulsion $ U(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j) $ between sites $i$ and $j$ is calculated by projecting the Coulomb repulsion $\tilde{U}(\bm{r})=e^2/(\epsilon r)$ onto the Wannier states. Here $\epsilon$ is the effective background dielectric constant that can be controlled by the three-dimensional dielectric environment. We take $\epsilon$ as a free parameter in our theory since its precise value is tunable (and not always precisely known). Numerical values of $U_0$ (on site repulsion) and $U_n$ ($n=1,2,3$ for repulsion between $n$-th nearest neighbors) are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:hopping}(b). For a typical value of $\epsilon$ about 10, the on-site interaction $U_0$ can be at least one order-of-magnitude greater than the hopping parameters for twist angle $\theta$ below $5^{\circ}$. Therefore, tWSe$_2$ provides a platform to simulate the generalized Hubbard model on a triangular lattice. Moreover, the hopping parameters can be {\it in situ} controlled by an external displacement field. The effective interacting model is a generalized Hubbard model since both interaction and hopping in Eq.~\eqref{eq:hubbard} are not necessarily restricted to being on-site or nearest-neighbor, respectively as the whole many-body Hamiltonian matrix of Eq.~\eqref{eq:hubbard} can be calculated from our moir\'e band calculations for a given $ \epsilon $.


**Completion**  
You will be instructed to describe the kinetic term of Hamiltonian in a system with a triangular lattice in the real space in the second-quantized form.

The kinetic term is a tight-binding model composed of the following hopping process: 
between site i and site j with the amplitude $t_{s}\left(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j\right)$
You should ensure the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian
The summation should be taken over all spin states and all real space positions.  
Return the Kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{\text{TB}}$.

Use the following conventions for the symbols:  
$s= \uparrow,\downarrow\ $ represents spin $\uparrow$ and $\downarrow$ states associated respectively with $ +K $ and $-K$ valleys, $ \bm{R}_i $ represents a site in the triangular lattice, and $ c_{j,s} $ ($ c_{j,s}^\dagger $) is  electron annihilation (creation) operator. $t_{s}\left(\bm{R}_i-\bm{R}_j\right)$ is the hopping parameter.
