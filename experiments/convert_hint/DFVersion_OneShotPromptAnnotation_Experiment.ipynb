You should follow the EXAMPLE below to apply the Fourier transformation. [Note that interaction have no position dependence now]\\nYou should recall that {second_int_symbol} is {expression_int}.\\nExpress {second_int_symbol} in terms of {momentum_creation_op}. Simplify any summation index if possible.  \\n\\n===  \\nEXAMPLE:  \\nWrite an interacting Hamiltonian $\\\\hat{{H}}^{{int}}$ in the second quantized form in the real space, $\\\\hat{{H}}^{{int}}=\\\\sum_{{s,s'}}\\\\sum_{{i,j}} U(R_i-R_j) c_s^\\\\dagger(R_i) c_{{s'}}^\\\\dagger(R_j) c_{{s'}}(R_j) c_s(R_i)$, where $i,j$ are summed over the entire real space.  \\nDefine the Fourier transformation $c_s^\\\\dagger(k)=\\\\frac{{1}}{{\\\\sqrt{{N}}}} \\\\sum_{{i}}c_s^\\\\dagger(R_i) e^{{i k \\\\cdot R_i}}$, where $i$ is integrated over the entire real space containing $N$ unit cells, $N$ is the number of unit cells.  \\nThis leads to the inverse Fourier transformation $c_s^\\\\dagger(R_i) = \\\\frac{{1}}{{\\\\sqrt{{N}}}} \\\\sum_k c_s^\\\\dagger(k) e^{{-i k \\\\cdot R_i}}$, where $k$ is summed over the first Brillouin zone.  \\nThus, substitute $c^\\\\dagger(R_i)$ and $c(R_j)$ into $\\\\hat{{H}}^{{int}}$, we get  \\n$$\\\\hat{{H}}^{{int}} = \\\\sum_{{s,s'}}\\\\sum_{{i,j}} U(R_i-R_j) \\\\frac{{1}}{{\\\\sqrt{{N}}}} \\\\sum_{{k_1}} c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) e^{{-i k_1 \\\\cdot R_i}} \\\\frac{{1}}{{\\\\sqrt{{N}}}} \\\\sum_{{k_2}} c_{{s'}}^\\\\dagger(k_2) e^{{-i k_2 \\\\cdot R_j}} \\\\frac{{1}}{{\\\\sqrt{{N}}}} \\\\sum_{{k_3}} c_{{s'}}(k_3) e^{{i k_3 \\\\cdot R_j}} \\\\frac{{1}}{{\\\\sqrt{{N}}}} \\\\sum_{{k_4}} c_s(k_4) e^{{i

You should follow the EXAMPLE below to apply the Fourier transformation. [Note that interaction have no position dependence now]\\nYou should recall that $H_{int}$ is {expression_int}.\\nExpress $H_{int}$ in terms of $c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger$. Simplify any summation index if possible.  \\n\\n===  \\nEXAMPLE:  \\nWrite an interacting Hamiltonian $\\\\hat{{H}}^{{int}}$ in the second quantized form in the real space, $\\\\hat{{H}}^{{int}}=\\\\sum_{{s,s'}}\\\\sum_{{i,j}} U(R_i-R_j) c_s^\\\\dagger(R_i) c_{{s'}}^\\\\dagger(R_j) c_{{s'}}(R_j) c_s(R_i)$, where $i,j$ are summed over the entire real space.  \\nDefine the Fourier transformation $c_s^\\\\dagger(k)=\\\\frac{{1}}{{\\\\sqrt{{N}}}} \\\\sum_{{i}}c_s^\\\\dagger(R_i) e^{{i k \\\\cdot R_i}}$, where $i$ is integrated over the entire real space containing $N$ unit cells, $N$ is the number of unit cells.  \\nThis leads to the inverse Fourier transformation $c_s^\\\\dagger(R_i) = \\\\frac{{1}}{{\\\\sqrt{{N}}}} \\\\sum_k c_s^\\\\dagger(k) e^{{-i k \\\\cdot R_i}}$, where $k$ is summed over the first Brillouin zone.  \\nThus, substitute $c^\\\\dagger(R_i)$ and $c(R_j)$ into $\\\\hat{{H}}^{{int}}$, we get  \\n$$\\\\hat{{H}}^{{int}} = \\\\sum_{{s,s'}}\\\\sum_{{i,j}} U(R_i-R_j) \\\\frac{{1}}{{\\\\sqrt{{N}}}} \\\\sum_{{k_1}} c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) e^{{-i k_1 \\\\cdot R_i}} \\\\frac{{1}}{{\\\\sqrt{{N}}}} \\\\sum_{{k_2}} c_{{s'}}^\\\\dagger(k_2) e^{{-i k_2 \\\\cdot R_j}} \\\\frac{{1}}{{\\\\sqrt{{N}}}} \\\\sum_{{k_3}} c_{{s'}}(k_3) e^{{i k_3 \\\\cdot R_j}} \\\\frac{{1}}{{\\\\sqrt{{N}}}} \\\\sum_{{k_4}} c_s(k_4) e^{{i k_4 \\\\cdot R_i}}=\\\\sum_{{s,s'}}\\\\sum_{{i,j}}\\\\frac{{1}}{{N^2}}\\\\sum_{{k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4}}U(R_i-R_j)c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1)c_{{s'}}^\\\\dagger(k_2)c_{{s'}}(k_3)c_s(k_4)e^{{-i(k_1-k_4)\\\\cdot R_i}} e^{{-i(k_2-k_3)\\\\cdot R_j}}$$\\nNow make a replacement by defining $n= R_i-R_j$  \\nThe Hamiltonian become  \\n$$\\\\hat{{H}}^{{int}}=\\\\frac{{1}}{{N^2}} \\\\sum_{{j,n}} \\\\sum_{{s,s'}} \\\\sum_{{k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4}} U(n) c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1)c_{{s'}}^\\\\dagger(k_2)c_{{s'}}(k_3)c_s(k_4)e^{{-i(k_1-k_4)\\\\cdot n}} e^{{-i(k_1-k_4+k_2-k_3)\\\\cdot r_j }}$$\\nBecause $\\\\frac{{1}}{{N}}\\\\sum_{{i}} e^{{-i (k_1-k_4+k_2-k_3)\\\\cdot R_i}} = \\\\sum\\\\delta(k_1-k_4+k_2-k_3,G)$, where $\\\\delta(..,..)$ is the Kronecker delta function, and $G$ is the all reciprocal lattices in the momentum space.  \\nTherefore,  \\n$$\\\\hat{{H}}^{{int}}=\\\\frac{{1}}{{N}}\\\\sum_{{s,s'}}\\\\sum_{{k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4}} \\\\sum_{{n}} U(n) e^{{-i (k_1-k_4) \\\\cdot n}}

\\\\cdot n}}$, where $n$ is the summation of all hopping pairs, the interacting Hamiltonian in the momentum space is  \\n$$\\\\hat{{H}}^{{int}}=\\\\frac{{1}}{{N}}\\\\sum_{{s,s'}}\\\\sum_{{k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4}}  U(k_1-k_4) c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1)c_{{s'}}^\\\\dagger(k_2)c_{{s'}}(k_3)c_s(k_4) \\\\sum_{{G}}
