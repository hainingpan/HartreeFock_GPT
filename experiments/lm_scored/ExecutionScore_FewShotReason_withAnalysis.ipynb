You should use the property of Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta_{k_i,k_j}$ to reduce one momentum $k_i$ but not $b_i$. Once you reduce one momentum inside the expected value $\\\\langle\\\\dots\\\\rangle$. You will also notice the total momentum conservation will reduce another momentum in the quadratic term. Therefore, you should end up with only two momenta left in the summation. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to reduce one momentum in the Hartree term, and another momentum in the quadratic term. You should recall that $H_{\\\\text{Hartree}}$ is $H_{\\\\text{Hartree}} = \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{s,s'}\\\\sum_{k,k',q,q'} U(k-q) \\\\langle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q,s}\\\\rangle c_{k',s'}^\\\\dagger c_{q',s'}   \\\\sum_{G} \\\\delta(k-q+k'-q',G)$.. Return the final simplified Hartree term $H_{\\\\text{Hartree}}$.  === EXAMPLE: Given a Hamiltonian where the Hartree term $\\\\hat{H}^{Hartree}=\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+k_4+b_3+b_4}$, where $k_i$ is the momentum inside first Brilloun zone and $b_i$ is the reciprocal lattice. Inside the expected value, we realize $\\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle$ is nonzero only when $k_1=k_4$, i.e., $\\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle=\\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle\\\\delta_{k_1,k_4}$. Thus, the Hartree term becomes $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle \\\\delta_{k_1,k_4} c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+k_4+b_3+b_4}$. Use the property of Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta_{k_1,k_4}$ to sum over $k_4$, we have $\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_1+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+k_1+b_3+b_4}=\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+b_3+b_4}$. Because $k_i$ is momentum inside first Brilloun zone while $b_i$ is the reciprocal lattice. It is only when $k_2=k_3$ that $\\\\delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+b_3+b_4}$ is nonzero, i.e., $\\\\delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+b_3+b_4}=\\\\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}\\\\delta_{k_2,k_3}$. Therefore, the Hartree term simplifies to $\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}\\\\delta_{k_2,k_3}=\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_2) \\\\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}$. Therefore, the final simplified Hartree term after reducing two momenta is $\\\\hat{H}^{Hartree}=\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4}  V(b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_2) \\\\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}$ \",\n          \"You will be instructed to perform a Hartree-Fock approximation to expand the interaction term, $\\\\mathcal{H}_{\\\\text{C}}$.

The degrees of freedom of the system are: spin index (spin up and spin down), orbital index ($d$ orbital in Cu atom, $p_x$ orbital in O atom, and $p_y$ orbital in O atom) The kinetic term is a tight-binding model composed of the following hopping process: 1. $c_{d,s}^\\\\dagger(R_i)$ and $c_{p_x,s}^\\\\dagger(R_i+\\\\hat{x}/2)$ with the hopping amplitude $-t_pd$. 2. $c_{d,s}^\\\\dagger(R_i)$ and $c_{p_x,s}^\\\\dagger(R_i-\\\\hat{x}/2)$ with the hopping amplitude $-t_pd$. 3. $c_{d,s}^\\\\dagger(R_i)$ and $c_{p_y,s}^\\\\dagger(R_i+\\\\hat{y}/2)$ with the hopping amplitude $-t_pd$. 4. $c_{d,s}^\\\\dagger(R_i)$ and $c_{p_y,s}^\\\\dagger(R_i-\\\\hat{y}/2)$ with the hopping amplitude $-t_pd$. 5. $c_{p_x,s}^\\\\dagger(R_i+\\\\hat{x}/2)$ and $c_{p_y,s}^\\\\dagger(R_i+\\\\hat{y}/2)$ with the hopping amplitude $-t_pp$. 6. $c_{p_x,s}^\\\\dagger(R_i+\\\\hat{x}/2)$ and $c_{p_y,s}^\\\\dagger(R_i-\\\\hat{y}/2)$ with the hopping amplitude $-t_pp$. 7. $c_{p_x,s}^\\\\dagger(R_i-\\\\hat{x}/2)$ and $c_{p_y,s}^\\\\dagger(R_i+\\\\hat{y}/2)$ with the hopping amplitude $-t_pp$. 8. $c_{p_x,s}^\\\\dagger(R_i-\\\\hat{x}/2)$ and $c_{p_y,s}^\\\\dagger(R_i-\\\\hat{y}/2)$ with the hopping amplitude $-t_pp$.  You should ensure the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian The summation should be taken over all spin index (spin up and spin down), orbital index ($d$ orbital in Cu atom, $p_x$ orbital in O atom, and $p_y$ orbital in O atom) and all real space positions. Return the Kinetic Hamiltonian $\\\\mathcal{H}_{0}$.

The same applies to the Fock term.

Finally, we have the simplified Hamiltonian as  $\\\\hat{H}=2\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_1-k_4) \\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. \\n\\nSOLUTION: Following the example provided, we can simplify the quadratic term $V^{HF}_{quadratic}$ by relabeling the indices.  For the second Hartree term, we swap the indices as follows: $\\\\lambda \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\lambda\\'$, $k_1 \\\\leftrightarrow k_2$, and $k_3 \\\\leftrightarrow k_4$. This gives us:  $\\\\langle c_{k_2,\\\\lambda\\'}^\\\\dagger c_{k_3,\\\\lambda\\'} \\\\rangle c_{k_1,\\\\lambda}^\\\\dagger c_{k_4,\\\\lambda}$  The Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta_{k_1+k_2, k_3+k_4}$ implies $k_1+k_2=k_3+k_4$, i.e., $k_2-k_3=k_4-k_1$. Thus, the second Hartree term simplifies to:  $\\\\langle c_{k_2,\\\\lambda\\'}^\\\\dagger c_{k_3,\\\\lambda\\'} \\\\rangle c_{k_1,\\\\lambda}^\\\\dagger c_{k_4,\\\\lambda} \\\\times \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2, k_3+k_4} \\\\times V(k_4-k_1)$  Because $V(q)=V(-q)$, meaning $V(k_4-k_1)=V(k_1-k_4)$, the second Hartree term further simplifies to:  $\\\\langle c_{k_2,\\\\lambda\\'}^\\\\dagger c_{k_3,\\\\lambda\\'} \\\\rangle c_{k_1,\\\\lambda}^\\\\dagger c_{k_4,\\\\lambda} \\\\times \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2, k_3+k_4} \\\\times V(k_1-k_4)$  This form of the second Hartree term after relabeling is identical to the first Hartree term.  Similarly, for the second Fock term, we swap the indices as follows: $\\\\lambda \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\lambda\\'$, $k_1 \\\\leftrightarrow k_2$, and $k_3 \\\\leftrightarrow k_4$. This gives us:  $\\\\langle c_{k_2,\\\\lambda\\'}^\\\\dagger c_{k_4,\\\\lambda} \\\\rangle c_{k_1,\\\\lambda}^\\\\dagger c_{k_3,\\\\lambda\\'} \\\\times \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2, k_3+k_4} \\\\times V(k_4-k_1)$  Again, because $V(q)=V(-q)$, meaning $V(k_4-k_1)=V(k_1-k_4)$, the second Fock term further simplifies to:  $\\\\langle c_{k_2,\\\\lambda\\'}^\\\\dagger c_{k_4,\\\\lambda} \\\\rangle c_{k_1,\\\\lambda}^\\\\dagger c_{k_3,\\\\lambda\\'} \\\\times \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2, k_3+k_4} \\\\times V(k_1-k_4)$  This form of the second Fock term after relabeling is identical to the first Fock term.  Finally, we have the simplified $V^{HF}_{quadratic}$ as:  $V_{quadratic}^{HF} = \\\\frac{1}{A} \\\\sum_{\\\\lambda, \\\\lambda^{\\\\prime}, k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} \\\\left[ 2\\\\langle c_{k_1,\\\\lambda}^\\\\dagger c_{k_4,\\\\lambda} \\\\rangle c_{k_2,\\\\lambda^{\\\\prime}}^\\\\dagger c_{k_3,\\\\lambda^{\\\\prime}} - 2\\\\langle c_{k_1,\\\\lambda}^\\\\dagger c_{k_3,\\\\lambda^{\\\\prime}} \\\\rangle c_{k_2,\\\\lambda^{\\\\prime}}^\\\\dagger c_{k_4,\\\\lambda} \\\\right] \\\\times \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2, k_3+k_4} \\\\times V(k_1-k_4)$  This reduces the four terms (two Hartree and two Fock terms) to only two terms (one Hartree and one Fock term). \\n\\nSCORE: '}]\n",

Use the property of Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta_{k_1,k_3}$ to sum over $k_3$, we have $-\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_4) \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2+b_1+b_2,k_1+k_4+b_3+b_4}=-\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_4) \\\\delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_4+b_3+b_4}$. Because $k_i$ is momentum inside first Brilloun zone while $b_i$ is the reciprocal lattice. It is only when $k_2=k_4$ that $\\\\delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_4+b_3+b_4}$ is nonzero, i.e., $\\\\delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_4+b_3+b_4}=\\\\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}\\\\delta_{k_2,k_4}$. Therefore, the Fock term simplifies to $-\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4}  V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_4) \\\\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}\\\\delta_{k_2,k_4}=-\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_2+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_2) \\\\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}$.

We realize that $\\\\left< c^{\\\\dag}_{{\\\\bf k}_1 \\\\lambda} c_{{\\\\bf k'} \\\\lambda} \\\\right>$ is nonzero only when ${\\\\bf k}_1={\\\\bf k'}$, i.e., $\\\\left< c^{\\\\dag}_{{\\\\bf k}_1 \\\\lambda} c_{{\\\\bf k'} \\\\lambda} \\\\right>=\\\\left< c^{\\\\dag}_{{\\\\bf k}_1 \\\\lambda} c_{{\\\\bf k'} \\\\lambda} \\\\right>\\\\delta_{{\\\\bf k}_1,{\\\\bf k'}}$. Thus, the Fock term becomes $\\\\frac{1}{A} \\\\sum_{\\\\lambda, \\\\lambda^{\\\\prime}, k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4}  \\\\langle c_{k_1,\\\\lambda}^\\\\dagger c_{k_3,\\\\lambda^{\\\\prime}} \\\\rangle \\\\delta_{k_1,k_3} c_{k_2,\\\\lambda^{\\\\prime}}^\\\\dagger c_{k_4,\\\\lambda}  \\\\times \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2, k_3+k_4} \\\\times V(k_1-k_4)$.

Because of the total momentum conservation, it is only when $k_2=k_4$ that $\\\\delta_{k_1+k_2, k_1+k_4}$ is nonzero, i.e., $\\\\delta_{k_1+k_2, k_1+k_4}=\\\\delta_{k_2,k_4}$. Therefore, the Fock term simplifies to $\\\\frac{1}{A} \\\\sum_{\\\\lambda, \\\\lambda^{\\\\prime}, k_1, k_2}  \\\\langle c_{k_1,\\\\lambda}^\\\\dagger c_{k_1,\\\\lambda^{\\\\prime}} \\\\rangle c_{k_2,\\\\lambda^{\\\\prime}}^\\\\dagger c_{k_2,\\\\lambda}  \\\\times V(k_1-k_2)$.

Important: $d$ and $p$ cannot be swapped because they are not indices in the summation.

Return the final simplified Hartree term $\\\\hat{H}^{int,Hartree}$.  === EXAMPLE: Given a Hamiltonian where the Hartree term $\\\\hat{H}^{Hartree}=\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,s_1,s_2} V(k_1-k_4) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_2}(k_3) \\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_1+k_2-k_3-k_4,G}$, where $k_i$ is the momentum inside first Brilloun zone, $G$ is the reciprocal lattice vectors, and $s_i$ is a certain index for the degree of freedom other than momentum. Inside the expected value, we realize $\\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_4) \\\\rangle$ is nonzero only when $k_1=k_4$, i.e., $\\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_4) \\\\rangle=\\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_4) \\\\rangle\\\\delta_{k_1,k_4}$. Thus, the Hartree term becomes $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,s_1,s_2} V(k_1-k_4) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_4) \\\\rangle \\\\delta_{k_1,k_4} c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_2}(k_3) \\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_1+k_2-k_3-k_4,G}$. Use the property of Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta_{k_1,k_4}$ to sum over $k_4$, we have $\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3,s_1,s_2} V(k_1-k_1) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_2}(k_3) \\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_1+k_2-k_3-k_1,G}=\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3,s_1,s_2} V(0) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_2}(k_3) \\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_2-k_3,G}$. We can further simplify $\\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_2-k_3,G}$. Because $k_i$ is momentum inside first Brilloun zone, and the difference between $k_2$ and $k_3$ cannot exceed the first shell of reciprocal lattice vector, which means $G$ can only take the value of the origin point in the reciprocal lattice, therefore, $\\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_2-k_3,G}=\\\\delta_{k_2-k_3,0}$. Thus, the Hartree term simplifies to $\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3,s_1,s_2} V(0) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_2}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_2-k_3,0}=\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2,s_1,s_2} V(0) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_2}(k_2)$. Therefore, the final simplified Hartree term after reducing one momentum is $\\\\hat{H}^{Hartree}=\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2,s_1,s_2} V(0) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_2}(k_2)$ \\n\\nSOLUTION: Following the example, we can simplify the Hartree term $\\\\hat{H}^{int,Hartree}$ by reducing the momentum inside the expected value $\\\\langle c_{\\\\alpha_i,s_i}^\\\\dagger(k_i) c_{\\\\alpha_j,s_j}(k_j) \\\\rangle$ and using the total momentum conservation to reduce another momentum in the quadratic term.

If there is a further shift of $q$ in the momentum $k$, the dispersion will become $E_{\\\\alpha}=\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 (k-q)^2}{2m_{\\\\alpha}}$.

It can be expressed as γ_1 = -cos((k-q) a / 2), where q is the shift in momentum.  3. γ_2: This term represents the third-nearest-neighbor hopping energy. It can be expressed as γ_2 = -cos((k-2q) a / 2), where 2q is the shift in momentum.  4. γ_3: This term represents the fourth-nearest-neighbor hopping energy. It can be expressed as γ_3 = -cos((k-3q) a / 2), where 3q is the shift in momentum.  5. γ_N: This term represents the Nth-nearest-neighbor hopping energy. It can be expressed as γ_N = γ_N^0 * exp(- |k - K'| / k_r), where k_r = γ_1 / ħυ_F = 0.0573 Å^-1.  6. f(k): This term represents the phase factor. It can be expressed as f(k) = e^(i k_y a / sqrt(3)) * (1 + 2 e^(-i 3 k_{y} a / 2sqrt(3)) * cos(k_x a / 2)), where a = 2.46 Å.

Return the expanded form of $\\\\hat{H}_0$ after simplification.  Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know): $f\\\\left( {\\\\bf k} \\\\right) = e^{ i k_y a / \\\\sqrt{3} } \\\\left( 1 + 2 e^{-i 3 k_{y} a / 2\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\cos \\\\left(  \\\\frac{k_x a}{2} \\\\right)    \\\\right)$, where $a = 2.46 \\\\AA$. $\\\\gamma_0 = 3.12$ eV, $\\\\gamma_1 = 0.377$ eV,  $\\\\gamma_2 = 0.01$ eV,  $\\\\gamma_3 = 0.3$ eV. $\\\\gamma_N = \\\\gamma_N^{0} \\\\exp(- \\\\left| {\\\\bf k} - {\\\\bf K}^{(\\\\prime)} \\\\right| / k_r)$, where $k_r = \\\\gamma_1 / \\\\hbar \\\\upsilon_F = 0.0573 \\\\AA^{-1}$.   === EXAMPLE: For a $\\\\hat{H}=\\\\vec{\\\\psi}^\\\\dagger H \\\\vec{\\\\psi}$, where $\\\\vec{\\\\psi}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\psi_a \\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_b \\\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\\\vec{\\\\psi}^\\\\dagger=\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\psi_a^\\\\dagger & \\\\psi_b^\\\\dagger \\\\end{pmatrix}$, we can expand it as  $\\\\hat{H}=\\\\sum_{i,j=\\\\{a,b\\\\}} \\\\psi_i^\\\\dagger H_{i,j} \\\\psi_j$. \\n\\nSOLUTION: Given the Hamiltonian $\\\\hat{H}_0 = \\\\sum_{k} \\\\vec{\\\\psi}_{k}^{\\\\dagger} H_0(k) \\\\vec{\\\\psi}_{k}$, where $\\\\vec{\\\\psi}_{k}^{\\\\dagger} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\psi_{A,k}^{\\\\dagger} & \\\\psi_{B,k}^{\\\\dagger} & \\\\psi_{A',k}^{\\\\dagger} & \\\\psi_{B',k}^{\\\\dagger} & \\\\psi_{A'',k}^{\\\\dagger} & \\\\psi_{B'',k}^{\\\\dagger} \\\\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\\\vec{\\\\psi}_{k} = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\psi_{A,k} \\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_{B,k} \\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_{A',k} \\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_{B',k} \\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_{A'',k} \\\\\\\\ \\\\psi_{B'',k} \\\\end{pmatrix}$, we can expand it as:  $\\\\hat{H}_0 = \\\\sum_{k} \\\\sum_{i,j=\\\\{A,B,A',B',A'',B''\\\\}} \\\\psi_{i,k}^{\\\\dagger} H_{0,i,j}(k) \\\\psi_{j,k}$  where $H_{0,i,j}(k)$ are the elements of the Hamiltonian matrix $H_0(k)$, which are functions of the parameters γ_0, γ_1, γ_2, γ_3, γ_N, f and the momentum k.  The explicit form of $H_{0,i,j}(k)$ depends on the specific form of the Hamiltonian matrix, which is not provided in the question. However, given the definitions of γ_0, γ_1, γ_2, γ_3, γ_N, f, and the fact that the Hamiltonian is Hermitian, we can write down the general form of the Hamiltonian matrix elements:  $H_{0,i,j}(k) = \\\\gamma_0 \\\\delta_{i,j} + \\\\gamma_1 f(k) \\\\delta_{i,j+1} + \\\\gamma_2 f^2(k) \\\\delta_{i,j+2} + \\\\gamma_3 f^3(k) \\\\delta_{i,j+3} + \\\\gamma_N f^N(k) \\\\delta_{i,j+N}$  where $\\\\delta_{i,j}$ is the Kronecker delta function, which is 1 if i=j and 0 otherwise. The terms with f(k) represent the hopping terms between nearest, next-nearest, third-nearest, fourth-nearest, and Nth-nearest neighbors, respectively. The term with γ_0 represents the on-site energy.  Note that the indices i and j are cyclic, i.e., A+1=B, B+1=A', A'+1=B', B'+1=A'', A''+1=B'', B''+1=A.  The expanded form of $\\\\hat{H}_0$ after simplification is then:  $\\\\hat{H}_0 = \\\\sum_{k} \\\\left( \\\\gamma_0 \\\\sum_{i=\\\\{A,B,A',B',A'',B''\\\\}} \\\\psi_{i,k}^{\\\\dagger} \\\\psi_{i,k} + \\\\gamma_1 \\\\sum_{i,j=\\\\{A,B,A',B',A'',B''\\\\}} f(k) \\\\psi_{i,k}^{\\\\dagger} \\\\psi_{j+1,k} + \\\\gamma_2 \\\\sum_{i,j=\\\\{A,B,A',B',A'',B''\\\\}} f^2(k) \\\\psi_{i,k}^{\\\\dagger} \\\\psi_{j+2,k} + \\\\gamma_3 \\\\sum_{i,j=\\\\{A,B,A',B',A'',B''\\\\}} f^3(k) \\\\psi_{i,k}^{\\\\dagger} \\\\psi_{j+3,k} + \\\\gamma_N \\\\sum_{i,j=\\\\{A,B,A',B',A'',B''\\\\}} f^N(k) \\\\psi_{i,k}^{\\\\dagger} \\\\psi_{j+N,k} \\\\right)$  This is the expanded form of the Hamiltonian $\\\\hat{H}_0$ in terms of the creation and annihilation operators, the parameters γ_0, γ_1, γ_2, γ_3, γ_N, f, and the momentum k. \\n\\nSCORE: \"}]\n",

The same applies to the Fock term. This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the \"expected value\" and \"quadratic operators\" in the second Hartree term, you can make the second Hartree term look identical to the first Hartree term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.

Return the simplified $V_{HF}^{(2)}$ which reduces from four terms (two Hartree and two Fock terms) to only two terms (one Hartree and one Fock term)  === EXAMPLE: Given a Hamiltonian $\\\\hat{H}=\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_1-k_4) (\\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) + \\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) ) \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2,k_3+k_4}$, where $V(q)=V(-q)$. In the second term, we relabel the index to swap the index in expected value and the index in quadratic operators, namely, $\\\\sigma_1 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\sigma_2$, $\\\\sigma_3 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\sigma_4$, $k_1 \\\\leftrightarrow k_2$, $k_3 \\\\leftrightarrow k_4$. After the replacement, the second term becomes $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_2-k_3) \\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. Note that the Kronecker dirac function $\\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$ implies $k_1+k_2=k_3+k_4$, i.e., $k_2-k_3=k_4-k_1$. Thus, the second term simplifies to $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_4-k_1) \\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. Because $V(q)=V(-q)$, meaning $V(k_4-k_1)=V(k_1-k_4)$, the second term further simplifies to $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_1-k_4) \\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. Note that this form of second term after relabeling is identical to the first term.

For the second Hartree term, we swap the indices as follows: ${\\\\bf k}_1 \\\\leftrightarrow {\\\\bf k}_2$, ${\\\\bf k}_3 \\\\leftrightarrow {\\\\bf k}_4$, $\\\\lambda_1 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\lambda_2$. After the replacement, the second Hartree term becomes $\\\\langle c^{\\\\dag}_{{\\\\bf k}_1 \\\\lambda_1} c_{{\\\\bf k}_4 \\\\lambda_1} \\\\rangle c^{\\\\dag}_{{\\\\bf k}_2 \\\\lambda_2} c_{{\\\\bf k}_3 \\\\lambda_2}$, which is identical to the first Hartree term.  For the second Fock term, we swap the indices as follows: ${\\\\bf k}_1 \\\\leftrightarrow {\\\\bf k}_2$, ${\\\\bf k}_3 \\\\leftrightarrow {\\\\bf k}_4$, $\\\\lambda_1 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\lambda_2$. After the replacement, the second Fock term becomes $-\\\\langle c^{\\\\dag}_{{\\\\bf k}_1 \\\\lambda_1} c_{{\\\\bf k}_3 \\\\lambda_2} \\\\rangle c^{\\\\dag}_{{\\\\bf k}_2 \\\\lambda_2} c_{{\\\\bf k}_4 \\\\lambda_1}$, which is identical to the first Fock term.  Therefore, the simplified $V_{HF}^{(2)}$ is:  $V_{HF}^{(2)} = \\\\frac{1}{A} \\\\sum_{{\\\\bf k}_1, {\\\\bf k}_2, {\\\\bf k}_3, {\\\\bf k}_4} \\\\sum_{\\\\lambda_1, \\\\lambda_2} V({\\\\bf k}_1 - {\\\\bf k}_4) \\\\left[ \\\\langle c^{\\\\dag}_{{\\\\bf k}_1 \\\\lambda_1} c_{{\\\\bf k}_4 \\\\lambda_1} \\\\rangle c^{\\\\dag}_{{\\\\bf k}_2 \\\\lambda_2} c_{{\\\\bf k}_3 \\\\lambda_2} - \\\\langle c^{\\\\dag}_{{\\\\bf k}_1 \\\\lambda_1} c_{{\\\\bf k}_3 \\\\lambda_2} \\\\rangle c^{\\\\dag}_{{\\\\bf k}_2 \\\\lambda_2} c_{{\\\\bf k}_4 \\\\lambda_1} \\\\right] \\\\delta_{{\\\\bf k}_1 + {\\\\bf k}_2, {\\\\bf k}_3 + {\\\\bf k}_4}$.

In the second term, we relabel the index to swap the index in expected value and the index in quadratic operators, namely, $\\\\sigma_1 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\sigma_2$, $\\\\sigma_3 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\sigma_4$, $k_1 \\\\leftrightarrow k_2$, $k_3 \\\\leftrightarrow k_4$. Important: $d$ and $p$ cannot be swapped because they are not indices in the summation. After the replacement, the second term becomes $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_2-k_3) \\\\langle c_{p,\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{p,\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{d,\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{d,\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. Note that the Kronecker dirac function $\\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$ implies $k_1+k_2=k_3+k_4$, i.e., $k_2-k_3=k_4-k_1$. Thus, the second term simplifies to $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_4-k_1) \\\\langle c_{p,\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{p,\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{d,\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{d,\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. Because $V(q)=V(-q)$, meaning $V(k_4-k_1)=V(k_1-k_4)$, the second term further simplifies to $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_1-k_4) \\\\langle c_{p,\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{p,\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{d,\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{d,\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$.

We swap $\\\\alpha$ with $\\\\alpha^\\\\prime$, $\\\\beta$ with $\\\\beta^\\\\prime$, and $\\\\bf k$ with $\\\\bf k^\\\\prime$ in the second Hartree and Fock terms.  After the replacement, the second Hartree term becomes $\\\\langle d^{\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k^\\\\prime,\\\\alpha^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime} d^{\\\\phantom\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k^\\\\prime-\\\\bf q,\\\\beta^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime} \\\\rangle d^{\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k,\\\\alpha,\\\\sigma} d^{\\\\phantom\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k+\\\\bf q,\\\\beta,\\\\sigma}$, and the second Fock term becomes $\\\\langle d^{\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k^\\\\prime,\\\\alpha^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime} d^{\\\\phantom\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k+\\\\bf q,\\\\beta,\\\\sigma} \\\\rangle d^{\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k,\\\\alpha,\\\\sigma} d^{\\\\phantom\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k^\\\\prime-\\\\bf q,\\\\beta^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime}$.  Because $V(q)=V(-q)$, the interaction term $U^{\\\\sigma,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime}_{\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha^\\\\prime,\\\\beta,\\\\beta^\\\\prime}(\\\\bf q)$ remains the same after the replacement.  Therefore, the simplified $\\\\hat{H}_{\\\\rm {int}}^{HF,2}$ is:  $\\\\hat{H}_{\\\\rm {int}}^{HF,2} = 2\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha^\\\\prime,\\\\beta,\\\\beta^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime}\\\\sum_{\\\\bf k,\\\\bf k^\\\\prime,\\\\bf q} U^{\\\\sigma,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime}_{\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha^\\\\prime,\\\\beta,\\\\beta^\\\\prime}(\\\\bf q) \\\\left[ \\\\langle d^{\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k,\\\\alpha,\\\\sigma} d^{\\\\phantom\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k+\\\\bf q,\\\\beta,\\\\sigma} \\\\rangle d^{\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k^\\\\prime,\\\\alpha^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime} d^{\\\\phantom\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k^\\\\prime-\\\\bf q,\\\\beta^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime} - \\\\langle d^{\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k,\\\\alpha,\\\\sigma} d^{\\\\phantom\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k^\\\\prime-\\\\bf q,\\\\beta^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime} \\\\rangle d^{\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k^\\\\prime,\\\\alpha^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime} d^{\\\\phantom\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k+\\\\bf q,\\\\beta,\\\\sigma} \\\\right]$.

Inside the expected value, we realize $\\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_2}(k_3) \\\\rangle$ is nonzero only when $k_1=k_3$, i.e., $\\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_2}(k_3) \\\\rangle=\\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_2}(k_3) \\\\rangle\\\\delta_{k_1,k_3}$. Thus, the Fock term becomes $-\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,s_1,s_2} V(k_1-k_4) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_2}(k_3) \\\\rangle \\\\delta_{k_1,k_3} c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_1}(k_4) \\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_1+k_2-k_3-k_4,G}$. Use the property of Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta_{k_1,k_3}$ to sum over $k_3$, we have $-\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_4,s_1,s_2} V(k_1-k_4) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_2}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_1}(k_4) \\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_2-k_4,G}$. We can further simplify $\\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_2-k_4,G}$. Because $k_i$ is momentum inside first Brilloun zone, and the difference between $k_2$ and $k_4$ cannot exceed the first shell of reciprocal lattice vector, which means $G$ can only take the value of the origin point in the reciprocal lattice, therefore, $\\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_2-k_4,G}=\\\\delta_{k_2-k_4,0}$. Thus, the Fock term simplifies to $-\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_4,s_1,s_2} V(k_1-k_4) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_2}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_1}(k_4) \\\\delta_{k_2-k_4,0}=-\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2,s_1,s_2} V(k_1-k_2) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_2}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_1}(k_2)$. Therefore, the final simplified Fock term after reducing one momentum is $\\\\hat{H}^{Fock}=-\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2,s_1,s_2} V(k_1-k_2) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_2}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_1}(k_2)$ \\n\\nSOLUTION: Following the example, we can simplify the Fock term $\\\\hat{F}_{\\\\rm {int}}^{H,2}$ by reducing the momentum inside the expected value $\\\\langle d^{\\\\dagger}_{k,\\\\alpha,\\\\sigma} d_{k^\\\\prime-q,\\\\beta^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime} \\\\rangle$.  We know that $\\\\langle d^{\\\\dagger}_{k,\\\\alpha,\\\\sigma} d_{k^\\\\prime-q,\\\\beta^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime} \\\\rangle$ is nonzero only when $k=k^\\\\prime-q$, i.e., $\\\\langle d^{\\\\dagger}_{k,\\\\alpha,\\\\sigma} d_{k^\\\\prime-q,\\\\beta^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime} \\\\rangle=\\\\langle d^{\\\\dagger}_{k,\\\\alpha,\\\\sigma} d_{k^\\\\prime-q,\\\\beta^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime} \\\\rangle \\\\delta_{k,k'-q}$.  Substituting this into the Fock term, we get:  $\\\\hat{F}_{\\\\rm {int}}^{H,2} = - \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha^\\\\prime,\\\\beta,\\\\beta^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime}\\\\sum_{\\\\bf k,\\\\bf k^\\\\prime,\\\\bf q} U^{\\\\sigma,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime}_{\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha^\\\\prime,\\\\beta,\\\\beta^\\\\prime}(\\\\bf q) \\\\langle d^{\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k,\\\\alpha,\\\\sigma} d^{\\\\phantom\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k^\\\\prime-\\\\bf q,\\\\beta^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime} \\\\rangle \\\\delta_{k,k'-q} d^{\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k^\\\\prime,\\\\alpha^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime} d^{\\\\phantom\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k+\\\\bf q,\\\\beta,\\\\sigma}$.  Using the property of the Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta_{k,k'-q}$ to sum over $k^\\\\prime$, we get:  $\\\\hat{F}_{\\\\rm {int}}^{H,2} = - \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha^\\\\prime,\\\\beta,\\\\beta^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime}\\\\sum_{\\\\bf k,\\\\bf q} U^{\\\\sigma,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime}_{\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha^\\\\prime,\\\\beta,\\\\beta^\\\\prime}(\\\\bf q) \\\\langle d^{\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k,\\\\alpha,\\\\sigma} d^{\\\\phantom\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k,\\\\beta^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime} \\\\rangle d^{\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k,\\\\alpha^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime} d^{\\\\phantom\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k+\\\\bf q,\\\\beta,\\\\sigma}$.  Finally, we can simplify the term $\\\\delta_{k,k+q}$, which is nonzero only when $q=0$. Therefore, the final simplified Fock term $\\\\hat{F}_{\\\\rm {int}}^{H,2}$ is:  $\\\\hat{F}_{\\\\rm {int}}^{H,2} = - \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha^\\\\prime,\\\\beta,\\\\beta^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime}\\\\sum_{\\\\bf k} U^{\\\\sigma,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime}_{\\\\alpha,\\\\alpha^\\\\prime,\\\\beta,\\\\beta^\\\\prime}(0) \\\\langle d^{\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k,\\\\alpha,\\\\sigma} d^{\\\\phantom\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k,\\\\beta^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime} \\\\rangle d^{\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k,\\\\alpha^\\\\prime,\\\\sigma^\\\\prime} d^{\\\\phantom\\\\dagger}_{\\\\bf k,\\\\beta,\\\\sigma}$. \\n\\nSCORE: \"}]\n",

However, before adding, we need to relabel the indices in the Fock term to make the quadratic operators in the Fock term the same as those in the Hartree term.

The same applies to the Fock term. This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the \"expected value\" and \"quadratic operators\" in the second Hartree term, you can make the second Hartree term look identical to the first Hartree term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.

Return the simplified $\\\\hat{H}^{int,HF,2}$ which reduces from four terms (two Hartree and two Fock terms) to only two terms (one Hartree and one Fock term)  === EXAMPLE: Given a Hamiltonian $\\\\hat{H}=\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_1-k_4) (\\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) + \\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) ) \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2,k_3+k_4}$, where $V(q)=V(-q)$. In the second term, we relabel the index to swap the index in expected value and the index in quadratic operators, namely, $\\\\sigma_1 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\sigma_2$, $\\\\sigma_3 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\sigma_4$, $k_1 \\\\leftrightarrow k_2$, $k_3 \\\\leftrightarrow k_4$. After the replacement, the second term becomes $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_2-k_3) \\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. Note that the Kronecker dirac function $\\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$ implies $k_1+k_2=k_3+k_4$, i.e., $k_2-k_3=k_4-k_1$.

For the second Hartree term, we swap the indices as follows: $s_1 \\\\leftrightarrow s_2$, $\\\\tau_1 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\tau_2$, $l_1 \\\\leftrightarrow l_2$, $\\\\alpha_1 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\alpha_2$, $b_1 \\\\leftrightarrow b_2$, $b_3 \\\\leftrightarrow b_4$, $k_1 \\\\leftrightarrow k_2$, and $k_3 \\\\leftrightarrow k_4$.  After the replacement, the second Hartree term becomes $\\\\langle c^\\\\dagger_{s_2,\\\\tau_2,l_2,\\\\alpha_2,b_2}(k_2) c_{s_2,\\\\tau_2,l_2,\\\\alpha_2,b_3}(k_3) \\\\rangle c^\\\\dagger_{s_1,\\\\tau_1,l_1,\\\\alpha_1,b_1}(k_1) c_{s_1,\\\\tau_1,l_1,\\\\alpha_1,b_4}(k_4)$, which is identical to the first Hartree term.  For the second Fock term, we swap the indices as follows: $s_1 \\\\leftrightarrow s_2$, $\\\\tau_1 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\tau_2$, $l_1 \\\\leftrightarrow l_2$, $\\\\alpha_1 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\alpha_2$, $b_1 \\\\leftrightarrow b_2$, $b_3 \\\\leftrightarrow b_4$, $k_1 \\\\leftrightarrow k_2$, and $k_3 \\\\leftrightarrow k_4$.  After the replacement, the second Fock term becomes $\\\\langle c^\\\\dagger_{s_2,\\\\tau_2,l_2,\\\\alpha_2,b_2}(k_2) c_{s_1,\\\\tau_1,l_1,\\\\alpha_1,b_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c^\\\\dagger_{s_1,\\\\tau_1,l_1,\\\\alpha_1,b_1}(k_1) c_{s_2,\\\\tau_2,l_2,\\\\alpha_2,b_3}(k_3)$, which is identical to the first Fock term.

Inside the expected value, we realize $\\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_3) \\\\rangle$ is nonzero only when $k_1=k_3$, i.e., $\\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_3) \\\\rangle=\\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_3) \\\\rangle\\\\delta_{k_1,k_3}$.

The interaction term in the Hamiltonian is given by:  $$\\\\hat{H}^{int} = \\\\frac{1}{2N} \\\\sum_{s, s'} \\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} U(k_1 - k_4) c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s'}(k_3) c_s(k_4) \\\\sum_G \\\\delta(k_1-k_4+k_2-k_3, G)$$  This term is similar to the four-fermion term in EXAMPLE 1, so we can expand it in a similar way:  $$\\\\hat{H}^{int} = \\\\frac{1}{2N} \\\\sum_{s, s'} \\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} U(k_1 - k_4) \\\\left[ \\\\langle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_s(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{s'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s'}(k_3) + \\\\langle c_{s'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s'}(k_3) \\\\rangle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_s(k_4) - \\\\langle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_s(k_4) \\\\rangle \\\\langle c_{s'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s'}(k_3)\\\\rangle - \\\\langle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s'}(k_3) \\\\rangle c_{s'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_s(k_4) - \\\\langle c_{s'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_s(k_4) \\\\rangle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s'}(k_3) + \\\\langle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s'}(k_3)\\\\rangle \\\\langle c_{s'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_s(k_4) \\\\rangle \\\\right] \\\\sum_G \\\\delta(k_1-k_4+k_2-k_3, G)$$  After the Hartree-Fock approximation, we only preserve the normal terms, which are the product of a creation operator and an annihilation operator. Therefore, the expanded interaction term after Hartree-Fock approximation is:  $$\\\\hat{H}^{int,HF} = \\\\frac{1}{2N} \\\\sum_{s, s'} \\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} U(k_1 - k_4) \\\\left[ \\\\langle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_s(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{s'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s'}(k_3) + \\\\langle c_{s'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s'}(k_3) \\\\rangle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_s(k_4) \\\\right] \\\\sum_G \\\\delta(k_1-k_4+k_2-k_3, G)$$ \\n\\nSCORE: \"}]\n",

The logic is that the expected value ($\\\\langle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_s(k_4) \\\\rangle$) in the first Hartree term ($\\\\langle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_s(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{s\\'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s\\'}(k_3)$) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ($\\\\langle c_{s\\'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s\\'}(k_3) \\\\rangle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_s(k_4)$), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term. Namely, a replacement of $s$ and $s\\'$ is applied to ONLY the second Hartree or Fock term. You should not swap any index that is not in the summation, which includes Nothing. This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the \"expected value\" and \"quadratic operators\" in the second Hartree or Fock term, you can make the second Hartree or Fock term look identical to the first Hartree or Fock term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index. You should recall that $\\\\hat{H}^{HF,2}$ is $\\\\hat{H}^{int,HF,2} = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{s, s\\'} \\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} U(k_1 - k_4) \\\\left( \\\\langle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_s(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{s\\'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s\\'}(k_3) - \\\\langle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s\\'}(k_3) \\\\rangle c_{s\\'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_s(k_4)\\\\right) \\\\sum_G \\\\delta(k_1-k_4+k_2-k_3, G)$ Return the simplified $\\\\hat{H}^{HF,2}$.  === EXAMPLE: Given a Hamiltonian $\\\\hat{H}=\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_1-k_4) (\\\\langle c_{d,\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{d,\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{p,\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{p,\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) + \\\\langle c_{p,\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{d,\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\rangle c_{d,\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) ) \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2,k_3+k_4}$, where $V(q)=V(-q)$. In the second term, we relabel the index to swap the index in expected value and the index in quadratic operators, namely, $\\\\sigma_1 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\sigma_2$, $\\\\sigma_3 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\sigma_4$, $k_1 \\\\leftrightarrow k_2$, $k_3 \\\\leftrightarrow k_4$. Important: $d$ and $p$ cannot be swapped because they are not indices in the summation. After the replacement, the second term becomes $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_2-k_3) \\\\langle c_{p,\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{p,\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{d,\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{d,\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. Note that the Kronecker dirac function $\\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$ implies $k_1+k_2=k_3+k_4$, i.e., $k_2-k_3=k_4-k_1$. Thus, the second term simplifies to $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_4-k_1) \\\\langle c_{p,\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{p,\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{d,\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{d,\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. Because $V(q)=V(-q)$, meaning $V(k_4-k_1)=V(k_1-k_4)$, the second term further simplifies to $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_1-k_4) \\\\langle c_{p,\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{p,\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{d,\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{d,\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$.

We swap $s$ and $s\\'$, and $k_1$ with $k_2$, and $k_3$ with $k_4$. After the replacement, the second Hartree term becomes:  $$\\\\langle c_{s\\'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s\\'}(k_3) \\\\rangle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_s(k_4)$$  and the second Fock term becomes:  $$\\\\langle c_{s\\'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_s(k_1) \\\\rangle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_4) c_{s\\'}(k_3)$$  The Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta(k_1-k_4+k_2-k_3, G)$ implies $k_1+k_2=k_3+k_4$, i.e., $k_2-k_3=k_4-k_1$. Thus, the interaction term $U(k_1 - k_4)$ in the second Hartree and Fock terms can be rewritten as $U(k_2 - k_3)$.  Because $U(q)=U(-q)$, meaning $U(k_2-k_3)=U(k_1-k_4)$, the second Hartree and Fock terms can be simplified to:  $$U(k_1 - k_4) \\\\langle c_{s\\'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s\\'}(k_3) \\\\rangle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_s(k_4)$$  and  $$U(k_1 - k_4) \\\\langle c_{s\\'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_s(k_1) \\\\rangle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_4) c_{s\\'}(k_3)$$  respectively.

Inside the expected value, we realize $\\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_4) \\\\rangle$ is nonzero only when $k_1=k_4$, i.e., $\\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_4) \\\\rangle=\\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_4) \\\\rangle\\\\delta_{k_1,k_4}$.

The expected value $\\\\langle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s'}(k_3) \\\\rangle$ is only nonzero when the two momenta $k_i,k_j$ are the same, namely, $\\\\langle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s'}(k_3) \\\\rangle=\\\\langle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s'}(k_3) \\\\rangle \\\\delta_{k_1,k_3}$. You should use the property of Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta_{k_i,k_j}$ to reduce one momentum $k_i$. Once you reduce one momentum inside the expected value $\\\\langle\\\\dots\\\\rangle$. You will also notice the total momentum conservation will reduce another momentum in the quadratic term. Therefore, you should end up with only two momenta left in the summation. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to reduce one momentum in the Fock term, and another momentum in the quadratic term. You should recall that $H_{\\\\text{Fock}}$ is $\\\\hat{H}^{int,HF,2} = -\\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{s, s'} \\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} U(k_1 - k_4) \\\\langle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s'}(k_3) \\\\rangle c_{s'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_s(k_4) \\\\sum_G \\\\delta(k_1-k_4+k_2-k_3, G)$. Return the final simplified Fock term $H_{\\\\text{Fock}}$.  === EXAMPLE: Given a Hamiltonian where the Fock term $\\\\hat{H}^{Fock}=-\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,s_1,s_2} V(k_1-k_4) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_2}(k_3) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_1}(k_4)  \\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_1+k_2-k_3-k_4,G}$, where $k_i$ is the momentum inside first Brilloun zone, $G$ is the reciprocal lattice vectors, and $s_i$ is a certain index for the degree of freedom other than momentum. Inside the expected value, we realize $\\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_2}(k_3) \\\\rangle$ is nonzero only when $k_1=k_3$, i.e., $\\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_2}(k_3) \\\\rangle=\\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_2}(k_3) \\\\rangle\\\\delta_{k_1,k_3}$. Thus, the Fock term becomes $-\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,s_1,s_2} V(k_1-k_4) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_2}(k_3) \\\\rangle \\\\delta_{k_1,k_3} c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_1}(k_4) \\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_1+k_2-k_3-k_4,G}$. Use the property of Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta_{k_1,k_3}$ to sum over $k_3$, we have $-\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_4,s_1,s_2} V(k_1-k_4) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_2}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_1}(k_4) \\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_2-k_4,G}$. We can further simplify $\\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_2-k_4,G}$. Because $k_i$ is momentum inside first Brilloun zone, and the difference between $k_2$ and $k_4$ cannot exceed the first shell of reciprocal lattice vector, which means $G$ can only take the value of the origin point in the reciprocal lattice, therefore, $\\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_2-k_4,G}=\\\\delta_{k_2-k_4,0}$. Thus, the Fock term simplifies to $-\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_4,s_1,s_2} V(k_1-k_4) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_2}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_1}(k_4) \\\\delta_{k_2-k_4,0}=-\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2,s_1,s_2} V(k_1-k_2) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_2}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_1}(k_2)$. Therefore, the final simplified Fock term after reducing one momentum is $\\\\hat{H}^{Fock}=-\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2,s_1,s_2} V(k_1-k_2) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_2}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_1}(k_2)$ \\n\\nSOLUTION: To simplify the Fock term in $H_{\\\\text{Fock}}$, we first note that the expectation value $\\\\langle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s'}(k_3) \\\\rangle$ is nonzero only when $k_1=k_3$, i.e., $\\\\langle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s'}(k_3) \\\\rangle=\\\\langle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s'}(k_3) \\\\rangle \\\\delta_{k_1,k_3}$.  Substituting this into the Fock term, we get:  $$H_{\\\\text{Fock}} = -\\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{s, s'} \\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} U(k_1 - k_4) \\\\langle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s'}(k_3) \\\\rangle \\\\delta_{k_1,k_3} c_{s'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_s(k_4) \\\\sum_G \\\\delta(k_1-k_4+k_2-k_3, G)$$  Using the property of the Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta_{k_1,k_3}$ to sum over $k_3$, we get:  $$H_{\\\\text{Fock}} = -\\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{s, s'} \\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_4} U(k_1 - k_4) \\\\langle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s'}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_s(k_4) \\\\sum_G \\\\delta(k_1-k_4+k_2-k_1, G)$$  Simplifying the delta function $\\\\sum_G \\\\delta(k_1-k_4+k_2-k_1, G)$, we get $\\\\delta_{k_2,k_4}$, as the difference between $k_2$ and $k_4$ cannot exceed the first shell of reciprocal lattice vector.  Therefore, the Fock term simplifies to:  $$H_{\\\\text{Fock}} = -\\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{s, s'} \\\\sum_{k_1, k_2} U(k_1 - k_2) \\\\langle c_s^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s'}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s'}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_s(k_2)$$  This is the final simplified Fock term after reducing one momentum. \\n\\nSCORE: \"}]\n",

In the second term, we relabel the index to swap the index in expected value and the index in quadratic operators, namely, $\\\\sigma_1 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\sigma_2$, $\\\\sigma_3 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\sigma_4$, $k_1 \\\\leftrightarrow k_2$, $k_3 \\\\leftrightarrow k_4$. Important: $d$ and $p$ cannot be swapped because they are not indices in the summation. After the replacement, the second term becomes $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_2-k_3) \\\\langle c_{p,\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{p,\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{d,\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{d,\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$.

The Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta_{\\\\bm{k}_\\\\alpha,\\\\bm{k}_\\\\beta,\\\\bm{k}_\\\\gamma,\\\\bm{k}_\\\\delta}$ implies $\\\\bm{k}_\\\\alpha+\\\\bm{k}_\\\\beta=\\\\bm{k}_\\\\gamma+\\\\bm{k}_\\\\delta$, i.e., $\\\\bm{k}_\\\\beta-\\\\bm{k}_\\\\gamma=\\\\bm{k}_\\\\delta-\\\\bm{k}_\\\\alpha$.

It is only when $k_2=k_4$ that $\\\\delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_4+b_3+b_4}$ is nonzero, i.e., $\\\\delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_4+b_3+b_4}=\\\\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}\\\\delta_{k_2,k_4}$. Therefore, the Fock term simplifies to $-\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4}  V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_4) \\\\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}\\\\delta_{k_2,k_4}=-\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_2+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_2) \\\\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}$.

We realize that $\\\\langle{c_{\\\\bm{p}_\\\\alpha,\\\\bm{q}_\\\\alpha,s}^\\\\dagger c_{\\\\bm{p}_\\\\gamma,\\\\bm{q}_\\\\gamma,s'}}\\\\rangle$ is nonzero only when $\\\\bm{p}_\\\\alpha=\\\\bm{p}_\\\\gamma$, i.e., $\\\\langle{c_{\\\\bm{p}_\\\\alpha,\\\\bm{q}_\\\\alpha,s}^\\\\dagger c_{\\\\bm{p}_\\\\gamma,\\\\bm{q}_\\\\gamma,s'}}\\\\rangle=\\\\langle{c_{\\\\bm{p}_\\\\alpha,\\\\bm{q}_\\\\alpha,s}^\\\\dagger c_{\\\\bm{p}_\\\\gamma,\\\\bm{q}_\\\\gamma,s'}}\\\\rangle\\\\delta_{\\\\bm{p}_\\\\alpha,\\\\bm{p}_\\\\gamma}$.

Using the property of the Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta_{\\\\bm{p}_\\\\alpha,\\\\bm{p}_\\\\gamma}$ to sum over $\\\\bm{p}_\\\\gamma$, we have $-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathcal{N}}\\\\sum_{s,s'} \\\\sum_{\\\\bm{p},\\\\bm{q}} U(\\\\bm{p}_\\\\alpha+\\\\bm{q}_\\\\alpha-\\\\bm{p}_\\\\delta-\\\\bm{q}_\\\\delta)\\\\delta_{\\\\bm{p}_\\\\alpha+\\\\bm{q}_\\\\alpha+\\\\bm{p}_\\\\beta+\\\\bm{q}_\\\\beta,\\\\bm{p}_\\\\alpha+\\\\bm{q}_\\\\gamma+\\\\bm{p}_\\\\delta+\\\\bm{q}_\\\\delta} \\\\langle c_{\\\\bm{q}_\\\\alpha,s}^\\\\dagger(\\\\bm{p}_\\\\alpha) c_{\\\\bm{q}_\\\\gamma,s'}(\\\\bm{p}_\\\\alpha) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\bm{q}_\\\\beta,s'}^\\\\dagger(\\\\bm{p}_\\\\beta) c_{\\\\bm{q}_\\\\delta,s}(\\\\bm{p}_\\\\delta)$.  Because $\\\\bm{p}_\\\\alpha$ is the momentum inside the first Brillouin zone while $\\\\bm{q}_\\\\alpha$ is the reciprocal lattice, it is only when $\\\\bm{p}_\\\\beta=\\\\bm{p}_\\\\delta$ that $\\\\delta_{\\\\bm{p}_\\\\alpha+\\\\bm{q}_\\\\alpha+\\\\bm{p}_\\\\beta+\\\\bm{q}_\\\\beta,\\\\bm{p}_\\\\alpha+\\\\bm{q}_\\\\gamma+\\\\bm{p}_\\\\delta+\\\\bm{q}_\\\\delta}$ is nonzero, i.e., $\\\\delta_{\\\\bm{p}_\\\\alpha+\\\\bm{q}_\\\\alpha+\\\\bm{p}_\\\\beta+\\\\bm{q}_\\\\beta,\\\\bm{p}_\\\\alpha+\\\\bm{q}_\\\\gamma+\\\\bm{p}_\\\\delta+\\\\bm{q}_\\\\delta}=\\\\delta_{\\\\bm{q}_\\\\alpha+\\\\bm{q}_\\\\beta,\\\\bm{q}_\\\\gamma+\\\\bm{q}_\\\\delta}\\\\delta_{\\\\bm{p}_\\\\beta,\\\\bm{p}_\\\\delta}$.  Therefore, the Fock term simplifies to $-\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathcal{N}}\\\\sum_{s,s'} \\\\sum_{\\\\bm{p},\\\\bm{q}} U(\\\\bm{p}_\\\\alpha+\\\\bm{q}_\\\\alpha-\\\\bm{p}_\\\\beta-\\\\bm{q}_\\\\delta)\\\\delta_{\\\\bm{q}_\\\\alpha+\\\\bm{q}_\\\\beta,\\\\bm{q}_\\\\gamma+\\\\bm{q}_\\\\delta} \\\\langle c_{\\\\bm{q}_\\\\alpha,s}^\\\\dagger(\\\\bm{p}_\\\\alpha) c_{\\\\bm{q}_\\\\gamma,s'}(\\\\bm{p}_\\\\alpha) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\bm{q}_\\\\beta,s'}^\\\\dagger(\\\\bm{p}_\\\\beta) c_{\\\\bm{q}_\\\\delta,s}(\\\\bm{p}_\\\\beta)$.

We apply the replacement $\\\\bm{k}_1 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\bm{k}_3$, $\\\\bm{k}_2 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\bm{k}_4$, and $s \\\\leftrightarrow s\\'$ to ONLY the second Hartree or Fock term.  After the replacement, the second Hartree term becomes $\\\\langle c_{k_3,s\\'}^\\\\dagger c_{k_4,s\\'} \\\\rangle c_{k_1,s}^\\\\dagger c_{k_2,s}$ and the second Fock term becomes $-\\\\langle c_{k_3,s\\'}^\\\\dagger c_{k_2,s} \\\\rangle c_{k_1,s}^\\\\dagger c_{k_4,s\\'}$.  The Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta(k_1-k_2+k_3-k_4,G)$ implies $k_1-k_2=k_4-k_3$, i.e., $k_\\\\alpha-k_\\\\delta=k_4-k_3$. Thus, the interaction term $U(k_\\\\alpha-k_\\\\delta)$ simplifies to $U(k_4-k_3)$.  Because $U(q)=U(-q)$, meaning $U(k_4-k_3)=U(k_3-k_4)$, the interaction term further simplifies to $U(k_3-k_4)$.  Finally, we have the simplified $H_{int}^{HF,2}$ as:  $H_{int}^{HF,2} = \\\\frac{1}{2N} \\\\sum_{s,s\\'} \\\\sum_{k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4} U(k_3-k_4) \\\\left[ \\\\langle c_{k_1,s}^\\\\dagger c_{k_2,s} \\\\rangle c_{k_3,s\\'}^\\\\dagger c_{k_4,s\\'} + \\\\langle c_{k_3,s\\'}^\\\\dagger c_{k_4,s\\'} \\\\rangle c_{k_1,s}^\\\\dagger c_{k_2,s} - \\\\langle c_{k_1,s}^\\\\dagger c_{k_4,s\\'} \\\\rangle c_{k_3,s\\'}^\\\\dagger c_{k_2,s} - \\\\langle c_{k_3,s\\'}^\\\\dagger c_{k_2,s} \\\\rangle c_{k_1,s}^\\\\dagger c_{k_4,s\\'} \\\\right] \\\\sum_{G} \\\\delta(k_1-k_2+k_3-k_4,G).$ \\n\\nSCORE: '}]\n",

Therefore, the final simplified Fock term after reducing one momentum is $\\\\hat{H}^{Fock}=-\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2,s_1,s_2} V(k_1-k_2) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_2}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_1}(k_2)$ \\n\\nSOLUTION: The Fock term in the Hamiltonian is given by:  $H_{Fock} = -\\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{s,s'} \\\\sum_{k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4} U(k_3-k_4)  \\\\langle c_{k_1,s}^\\\\dagger c_{k_4,s'} \\\\rangle c_{k_3,s'}^\\\\dagger c_{k_2,s}\\\\sum_{G} \\\\delta(k_1-k_2+k_3-k_4,G)$.  We know that the expected value $\\\\langle c_{k_1,s}^\\\\dagger c_{k_4,s'} \\\\rangle$ is nonzero only when $k_1=k_4$, i.e., $\\\\langle c_{k_1,s}^\\\\dagger c_{k_4,s'} \\\\rangle=\\\\delta_{k_1,k_4}\\\\langle c_{k_1,s}^\\\\dagger c_{k_4,s'} \\\\rangle$.  Substituting this into the Fock term, we get:  $H_{Fock} = -\\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{s,s'} \\\\sum_{k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4} U(k_3-k_4)  \\\\delta_{k_1,k_4}\\\\langle c_{k_1,s}^\\\\dagger c_{k_4,s'} \\\\rangle c_{k_3,s'}^\\\\dagger c_{k_2,s}\\\\sum_{G} \\\\delta(k_1-k_2+k_3-k_4,G)$.  Using the property of the Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta_{k_1,k_4}$ to sum over $k_4$, we get:  $H_{Fock} = -\\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{s,s'} \\\\sum_{k_1,k_2,k_3} U(k_3-k_1)  \\\\langle c_{k_1,s}^\\\\dagger c_{k_1,s'} \\\\rangle c_{k_3,s'}^\\\\dagger c_{k_2,s}\\\\sum_{G} \\\\delta(k_1-k_2+k_3-k_1,G)$.  Simplifying the delta function $\\\\delta(k_1-k_2+k_3-k_1,G)$, we get $\\\\delta(k_3-k_2,G)$.  So, the Fock term becomes:  $H_{Fock} = -\\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{s,s'} \\\\sum_{k_1,k_2,k_3} U(k_3-k_1)  \\\\langle c_{k_1,s}^\\\\dagger c_{k_1,s'} \\\\rangle c_{k_3,s'}^\\\\dagger c_{k_2,s}\\\\sum_{G} \\\\delta(k_3-k_2,G)$.  Finally, using the property of the Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta(k_3-k_2,G)$ to sum over $k_3$, we get:  $H_{Fock} = -\\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{s,s'} \\\\sum_{k_1,k_2} U(k_2-k_1)  \\\\langle c_{k_1,s}^\\\\dagger c_{k_1,s'} \\\\rangle c_{k_2,s'}^\\\\dagger c_{k_2,s}$.  This is the final simplified Fock term after reducing one momentum in the expected value and another momentum in the quadratic term. \\n\\nSCORE: \"}]\n",

EXAMPLE 3: A dirac dispersion for electron/hole is a 2 by 2 matrix, i.e., $h_{\\\\theta}(k)=-\\\\hbar v_D |k| \\\\begin{pmatrix}  0 & e^{i(\\\\theta_{k}-\\\\theta)}\\\\\\\\ e^{-i(\\\\theta_{\\\\bar{k}}-\\\\theta)} & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}$, where $v_D$ is the Fermi velocity, $\\\\theta$ is the twist angle, and $\\\\theta_k$ indicates the azumith angle of $k$. If there is a further shift of $K_{\\\\theta}$ in the momentum $k$, the dispersion will become $h_{\\\\theta}(k)=-\\\\hbar v_D |k-K_{\\\\theta}| \\\\begin{pmatrix}  0 & e^{i(\\\\theta_{k-K_{\\\\theta}}-\\\\theta)}\\\\\\\\ e^{-i(\\\\theta_{k-K_{\\\\theta}}-\\\\theta)} & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}$. \\n\\nSOLUTION: Given the question and the examples, we are dealing with a parabolic dispersion for holes with a shift of $b$ in the momentum $k$. Therefore, we should follow Example 2.  The energy dispersion for a hole with a shift of $b$ in the momentum $k$ is given by:  $E_{\\\\sigma,b}(k)=-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 (k-b)^2}{2m^*}$  where $\\\\sigma$ indicates the type of hole, $m^*$ is the effective mass of the hole, and $\\\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.  The term ${H_{0}}_{\\\\bm{b},\\\\bm{b}'}(\\\\bm{k})$ in the kinetic Hamiltonian is then given by:  ${H_{0}}_{\\\\bm{b},\\\\bm{b}'}(\\\\bm{k}) = E_{\\\\sigma,b}(k) c_{\\\\sigma,b}^\\\\dagger(k) c_{\\\\sigma,b}(k)$  Substituting the expression for $E_{\\\\sigma,b}(k)$ into ${H_{0}}_{\\\\bm{b},\\\\bm{b}'}(\\\\bm{k})$, we get:  ${H_{0}}_{\\\\bm{b},\\\\bm{b}'}(\\\\bm{k}) = -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 (k-b)^2}{2m^*} c_{\\\\sigma,b}^\\\\dagger(k) c_{\\\\sigma,b}(k)$  This is the expression for ${H_{0}}_{\\\\bm{b},\\\\bm{b}'}(\\\\bm{k})$ in the kinetic Hamiltonian.  Finally, we substitute this into the kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{0}$:  $H_{0} = \\\\sum_{\\\\sigma,b,k} -\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2 (k-b)^2}{2m^*} c_{\\\\sigma,b}^\\\\dagger(k) c_{\\\\sigma,b}(k)$  This is the final form of the kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{0}$, which includes a summation over the spin index, the moiré reciprocal lattice vectors, and the momentum in the first moiré Brillouin zone. \\n\\nSCORE: \"}]\n",

The same applies to the Fock term. This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the \"expected value\" and \"quadratic operators\" in the second Hartree term, you can make the second Hartree term look identical to the first Hartree term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index. You should perform this trick of \"relabeling the index\" for both two Hartree terms and two Fock terms to reduce them to one Hartree term, and one Fock term.

Note that the Kronecker dirac function $\\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$ implies $k_1+k_2=k_3+k_4$, i.e., $k_2-k_3=k_4-k_1$. Thus, the second term simplifies to $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_4-k_1) \\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$.

Therefore, the simplified Hartree-Fock self-energy $\\\\Sigma^{HF}$ is:  $\\\\Sigma^{HF} = \\\\frac{1}{N A} \\\\sum_{\\\\sigma_1, \\\\sigma_2, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4} V(k_1+b_1-k_4-b_4) \\\\delta_{k_1+b_1+k_2+b_2,k_3+b_3+k_4+b_4} [\\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1,b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_1,b_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2,b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_2,b_3}(k_3) - \\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1,b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_2,b_3}(k_3) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2,b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_1,b_4}(k_4)]$.

Use the property of Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta_{k_1,k_4}$ to sum over $k_4$, we have $\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_1+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+k_1+b_3+b_4}=\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+b_3+b_4}$. Because $k_i$ is momentum inside first Brilloun zone while $b_i$ is the reciprocal lattice. It is only when $k_2=k_3$ that $\\\\delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+b_3+b_4}$ is nonzero, i.e., $\\\\delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+b_3+b_4}=\\\\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}\\\\delta_{k_2,k_3}$.

You should perform the same trick of relabeling the index in the Fock term to make the quadratic operators in the Fock term the same as those in the Hartree term. The relabeling should be done with a swap : Nothing. You should add them, relabel the index in Fock term, and simply their sum. Return the final sum of Hartree and Fock term. \\n\\nSOLUTION: To combine the Hartree term and the Fock term, we first write them down:  Hartree term: $\\\\Sigma^{int,Hartree,2} = \\\\frac{1}{N A} \\\\sum_{\\\\sigma_1, \\\\sigma_2, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, k_1, k_2} V(b_1-b_4) \\\\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}\\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1,b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_1,b_4}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2,b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_2,b_3}(k_2)$  Fock term: $\\\\Sigma^{int,Fock,2} = -\\\\frac{1}{N A} \\\\sum_{\\\\sigma_1, \\\\sigma_2, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, k_1, k_2} V(k_1+b_1-k_2-b_4) \\\\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}\\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1,b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_2,b_3}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2,b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_1,b_4}(k_2)$  The instruction states that no relabeling is required in the Fock term. Therefore, we can directly add the Hartree term and the Fock term:  $\\\\Sigma^{int,Hartree+Fock,2} = \\\\Sigma^{int,Hartree,2} + \\\\Sigma^{int,Fock,2}$  This gives us:  $\\\\Sigma^{int,Hartree+Fock,2} = \\\\frac{1}{N A} \\\\sum_{\\\\sigma_1, \\\\sigma_2, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, k_1, k_2} \\\\left[ V(b_1-b_4) \\\\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}\\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1,b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_1,b_4}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2,b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_2,b_3}(k_2) - V(k_1+b_1-k_2-b_4) \\\\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}\\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1,b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_2,b_3}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2,b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_1,b_4}(k_2) \\\\right]$  This is the final sum of the Hartree and Fock term. \\n\\nSCORE: '}]\n",

Define the Fourier transformation $c^\\\\dagger(k)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{N}} \\\\sum_{i}c^\\\\dagger(R_i) e^{i k \\\\cdot R_i}$, where $i$ is integrated over the entire real space containing $N$ unit cells, $N$ is the number of unit cells. This leads to the inverse Fourier transformation $c^\\\\dagger(R_i) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{N}} \\\\sum_k c^\\\\dagger(k) e^{-i k \\\\cdot R_i}$, where $k$ is first Brillouin zone. Thus, substitute $c^\\\\dagger(R_i)$ and $c(R_j)$ into $\\\\hat{H}$, we get $$\\\\hat{H} = \\\\sum_{i,j} t(R_i-R_j) \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{N}} \\\\sum_{k_1} c^\\\\dagger(k_1) e^{-i k_1 \\\\cdot R_i} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{N}} \\\\sum_{k_2} c(k_2) e^{i k_2 \\\\cdot R_j} =\\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2} c^\\\\dagger(k_1)  c(k_2)  e^{-i k_1\\\\cdot R_i} e^{i k_2 \\\\cdot R_j} t(R_i-R_j) $$ Now make a replacement by defining $n= R_i-R_j$ The Hamiltonian become $$\\\\hat{H}=\\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{i,n} \\\\sum_{k_1,k_2} c^\\\\dagger(k_1)  c(k_2) t(n) e^{-i (k_1-k_2)\\\\cdot R_i} e^{-i k_2 \\\\cdot n}$$ Because $\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{i} e^{-i (k_1-k_2)\\\\cdot R_i} = \\\\delta(k_1,k_2)$, where $\\\\delta(k_1,k_2)$ is the Kronecker delta function. therefore $$\\\\hat{H}=\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2} \\\\sum_{n} t(n) e^{-i k_2 \\\\cdot n} c^\\\\dagger(k_1)  c(k_2) \\\\delta(k_1,k_2)$$ Using the property of Kronecker delta function and sum over $k_2$, we obtain $$\\\\hat{H}=\\\\sum_{k_1} \\\\sum_{n} t(n) e^{-i k_1 \\\\cdot n} c^\\\\dagger(k_1)  c(k_1) $$ For simplicity, we replace $k_1$ with $k$, we obtain $$\\\\hat{H}=\\\\sum_{k} \\\\sum_{n} t(n) e^{-i k \\\\cdot n} c^\\\\dagger(k)  c(k)$$ If we define energy dispersion $E(k)=\\\\sum_{n} t(n) e^{-i k \\\\cdot n}$, where $n$ is the summation of all hopping pairs, the Hamiltonian in the momentum space is $$\\\\hat{H}=\\\\sum_{k} E(k) c^\\\\dagger(k)  c(k)$$ \\n\\nSOLUTION: Following the example, we first apply the Fourier transformation to the creation and annihilation operators in the Hamiltonian $H$.

The logic is that the expected value ($\\\\langle{c_{\\\\bm{k}_\\\\alpha,s}^\\\\dagger c_{\\\\bm{k}_\\\\delta,s}}\\\\rangle$ and $\\\\langle{c_{\\\\bm{k}_\\\\alpha,s}^\\\\dagger c_{\\\\bm{k}_\\\\gamma,s\\'}}\\\\rangle$) in the first Hartree term ($c_{\\\\bm{k}_\\\\beta,s\\'}^\\\\dagger c_{\\\\bm{k}_\\\\gamma,s\\'}$) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ($c_{\\\\bm{k}_\\\\beta,s\\'}^\\\\dagger c_{\\\\bm{k}_\\\\delta,s}$), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term. Namely, a replacement of $\\\\bm{k}_\\\\gamma \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\bm{k}_\\\\delta$ is applied to ONLY the second Hartree or Fock term. You should not swap any index that is not in the summation, which includes nothing here. This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the \"expected value\" and \"quadratic operators\" in the second Hartree or Fock term, you can make the second Hartree or Fock term look identical to the first Hartree or Fock term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction.

In the second term, we relabel the index to swap the index in expected value and the index in quadratic operators, namely, $\\\\sigma_1 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\sigma_2$, $\\\\sigma_3 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\sigma_4$, $k_1 \\\\leftrightarrow k_2$, $k_3 \\\\leftrightarrow k_4$. Important: $d$ and $p$ cannot be swapped because they are not indices in the summation. After the replacement, the second term becomes $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_2-k_3) \\\\langle c_{p,\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{p,\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{d,\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{d,\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. Note that the Kronecker dirac function $\\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$ implies $k_1+k_2=k_3+k_4$, i.e., $k_2-k_3=k_4-k_1$. Thus, the second term simplifies to $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_4-k_1) \\\\langle c_{p,\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{p,\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{d,\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{d,\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. Because $V(q)=V(-q)$, meaning $V(k_4-k_1)=V(k_1-k_4)$, the second term further simplifies to $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_1-k_4) \\\\langle c_{p,\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{p,\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{d,\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{d,\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. Finally, we have the simplified Hamiltonian as  $\\\\hat{H}=\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_1-k_4) (\\\\langle c_{d,\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{d,\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{p,\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{p,\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) + \\\\langle c_{p,\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{p,\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{d,\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{d,\\\\sigma_3}(k_3)) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. \\n\\nSOLUTION: Following the logic and example provided, we can simplify the quadratic term $H_{\\\\text{int}}$ by relabeling the index. Specifically, we swap the indices in the expected value and the quadratic operators in the second Hartree or Fock term.  For the second Hartree term, we swap $k \\\\leftrightarrow k\\'$ and $q \\\\leftrightarrow q\\'$. After the replacement, the second Hartree term becomes $\\\\langle c_{k\\',s\\'}^\\\\dagger c_{q\\',s\\'}\\\\rangle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q,s}$.  For the second Fock term, we swap $k \\\\leftrightarrow k\\'$ and $q \\\\leftrightarrow q\\'$. After the replacement, the second Fock term becomes $-\\\\langle c_{k\\',s\\'}^\\\\dagger c_{q,s} \\\\rangle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q\\',s\\'}$.  Therefore, the simplified $H_{\\\\text{int}}$ is:  $H_{\\\\text{int}} = \\\\frac{1}{2N}\\\\sum_{s,s\\'}\\\\sum_{k,k\\',q,q\\'} U(k-q) \\\\left[\\\\langle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q,s}\\\\rangle c_{k\\',s\\'}^\\\\dagger c_{q\\',s\\'} + \\\\langle c_{k\\',s\\'}^\\\\dagger c_{q\\',s\\'}\\\\rangle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q,s} - \\\\langle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q\\',s\\'} \\\\rangle c_{k\\',s\\'}^\\\\dagger c_{q,s} -  \\\\langle c_{k\\',s\\'}^\\\\dagger c_{q,s} \\\\rangle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q\\',s\\'}\\\\right] \\\\sum_{G} \\\\delta(k-q+k\\'-q\\',G)$.  This simplification is valid as long as $U(q)=U(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. \\n\\nSCORE: '}]\n",

The expected value $\\\\langle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q',s'} \\\\rangle$ is only nonzero when the two momenta $k_i,k_j$ are the same, namely, $\\\\langle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q',s'} \\\\rangle=\\\\langle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q',s'} \\\\rangle\\\\delta_{k,q'}$. You should use the property of Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta_{k_i,k_j}$ to reduce one momentum $k_i$ but not $b_i$. Once you reduce one momentum inside the expected value $\\\\langle\\\\dots\\\\rangle$. You will also notice the total momentum conservation will reduce another momentum in the quadratic term. Therefore, you should end up with only two momenta left in the summation. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to reduce one momentum in the Fock term, and another momentum in the quadratic term. You should recall that $H_{\\\\text{Fock}}$ is $H_{\\\\text{Fock}} = -\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{s,s'}\\\\sum_{k,k',q,q'} U(k-q)  \\\\langle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q',s'} \\\\rangle c_{k',s'}^\\\\dagger c_{q,s} \\\\sum_{G} \\\\delta(k-q+k'-q',G)$. Return the final simplified Fock term $H_{\\\\text{Fock}}$.  === EXAMPLE: Given a Hamiltonian where the Fock term $\\\\hat{H}^{Fock}=-\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_3) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_4)  \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+k_4+b_3+b_4}$, where $k_i$ is the momentum inside first Brilloun zone and $b_i$ is the reciprocal lattice. Inside the expected value, we realize $\\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_3) \\\\rangle$ is nonzero only when $k_1=k_3$, i.e., $\\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_3) \\\\rangle=\\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_3) \\\\rangle\\\\delta_{k_1,k_3}$. Thus, the Fock term becomes $-\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_3) \\\\rangle \\\\delta_{k_1,k_3} c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_4) \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+k_4+b_3+b_4}$. Use the property of Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta_{k_1,k_3}$ to sum over $k_3$, we have $-\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_4) \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2+b_1+b_2,k_1+k_4+b_3+b_4}=-\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_4) \\\\delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_4+b_3+b_4}$. Because $k_i$ is momentum inside first Brilloun zone while $b_i$ is the reciprocal lattice. It is only when $k_2=k_4$ that $\\\\delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_4+b_3+b_4}$ is nonzero, i.e., $\\\\delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_4+b_3+b_4}=\\\\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}\\\\delta_{k_2,k_4}$. Therefore, the Fock term simplifies to $-\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4}  V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_4) \\\\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}\\\\delta_{k_2,k_4}=-\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_2+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_2) \\\\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}$. Therefore, the final simplified Fock term after reducing two momenta is $\\\\hat{H}^{Fock}=-\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4}  V(k_1-k_2+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_3}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_4}(k_2) \\\\delta_{b_1+b_2,b_3+b_4}$ \\n\\nSOLUTION: Given the Fock term $H_{\\\\text{Fock}} = -\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{s,s'}\\\\sum_{k,k',q,q'} U(k-q)  \\\\langle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q',s'} \\\\rangle c_{k',s'}^\\\\dagger c_{q,s} \\\\sum_{G} \\\\delta(k-q+k'-q',G)$, we can simplify it by reducing the momentum inside the expected value $\\\\langle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q',s'} \\\\rangle$.  We know that $\\\\langle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q',s'} \\\\rangle$ is nonzero only when $k=q'$, i.e., $\\\\langle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q',s'} \\\\rangle=\\\\langle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q',s'} \\\\rangle\\\\delta_{k,q'}$.  Substituting this into the Fock term, we get:  $H_{\\\\text{Fock}} = -\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{s,s'}\\\\sum_{k,k',q,q'} U(k-q)  \\\\langle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q',s'} \\\\rangle \\\\delta_{k,q'} c_{k',s'}^\\\\dagger c_{q,s} \\\\sum_{G} \\\\delta(k-q+k'-q',G)$.

Next, we notice that the total momentum conservation will reduce another momentum in the quadratic term. The Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta(k-q+k'-q,G)$ is nonzero only when $k'-q=k$, i.e., $\\\\delta(k-q+k'-q,G)=\\\\delta_{k,k'}\\\\delta_{G,0}$.  Substituting this into the Fock term, we get:  $H_{\\\\text{Fock}} = -\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{s,s'}\\\\sum_{k,k',q} U(k-q)  \\\\langle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{k,s'} \\\\rangle c_{k',s'}^\\\\dagger c_{q,s} \\\\delta_{k,k'}\\\\delta_{G,0}$.

The same applies to the Fock term. This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the \"expected value\" and \"quadratic operators\" in the second Hartree term, you can make the second Hartree term look identical to the first Hartree term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index.

In the second term, we relabel the index to swap the index in expected value and the index in quadratic operators, namely, $\\\\sigma_1 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\sigma_2$, $\\\\sigma_3 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\sigma_4$, $k_1 \\\\leftrightarrow k_2$, $k_3 \\\\leftrightarrow k_4$. After the replacement, the second term becomes $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_2-k_3) \\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. Note that the Kronecker dirac function $\\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$ implies $k_1+k_2=k_3+k_4$, i.e., $k_2-k_3=k_4-k_1$.

Since the interaction potential $V(q)$ satisfies $V(q)=V(-q)$, the simplified Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian $\\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{H}}^{\\\\text{HF}}$ is given by:  $$ \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{H}}^{\\\\text{HF}} = \\\\frac{1}{2V}\\\\sum_{\\\\tau_1,\\\\tau_2,l_1,l_2,k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4} \\\\left[2\\\\langle b_{l_1,\\\\tau_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) b_{l_1,\\\\tau_1}(k_4) \\\\rangle b_{l_2,\\\\tau_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) b_{l_2,\\\\tau_2}(k_3) - 2\\\\langle b_{l_1,\\\\tau_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) b_{l_2,\\\\tau_2}(k_3) \\\\rangle b_{l_2,\\\\tau_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) b_{l_1,\\\\tau_1}(k_4)\\\\right] V(|k_1-k_4|)\\\\delta_{k_1+k_2,k_3+k_4} $$  This reduces the four terms (two Hartree and two Fock terms) to only two terms (one Hartree and one Fock term). \\n\\nSCORE: '}]\n",

You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index. You should perform this trick of \"relabeling the index\" for both two Hartree terms and two Fock terms to reduce them to one Hartree term, and one Fock term.

Return the simplified $H_{\\\\rm{MF}}$ which reduces from four terms (two Hartree and two Fock terms) to only two terms (one Hartree and one Fock term)  === EXAMPLE: Given a Hamiltonian $\\\\hat{H}=\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_1-k_4) (\\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) + \\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) ) \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2,k_3+k_4}$, where $V(q)=V(-q)$. In the second term, we relabel the index to swap the index in expected value and the index in quadratic operators, namely, $\\\\sigma_1 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\sigma_2$, $\\\\sigma_3 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\sigma_4$, $k_1 \\\\leftrightarrow k_2$, $k_3 \\\\leftrightarrow k_4$.

Note that the Kronecker dirac function $\\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$ implies $k_1+k_2=k_3+k_4$, i.e., $k_2-k_3=k_4-k_1$.

Important: $d$ and $p$ cannot be swapped because they are not indices in the summation. After the replacement, the second term becomes $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_2-k_3) \\\\langle c_{p,\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{p,\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{d,\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{d,\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$.

Return the final simplified Hartree term $h_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}^{\\\\text{H}}(\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\sigma)$.  === EXAMPLE: Given a Hamiltonian where the Hartree term $\\\\hat{H}^{Hartree}=\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,s_1,s_2} V(k_1-k_4) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_2}(k_3) \\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_1+k_2-k_3-k_4,G}$, where $k_i$ is the momentum inside first Brilloun zone, $G$ is the reciprocal lattice vectors, and $s_i$ is a certain index for the degree of freedom other than momentum. Inside the expected value, we realize $\\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_4) \\\\rangle$ is nonzero only when $k_1=k_4$, i.e., $\\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_4) \\\\rangle=\\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_4) \\\\rangle\\\\delta_{k_1,k_4}$. Thus, the Hartree term becomes $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,s_1,s_2} V(k_1-k_4) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_4) \\\\rangle \\\\delta_{k_1,k_4} c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_2}(k_3) \\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_1+k_2-k_3-k_4,G}$. Use the property of Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta_{k_1,k_4}$ to sum over $k_4$, we have $\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3,s_1,s_2} V(k_1-k_1) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_2}(k_3) \\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_1+k_2-k_3-k_1,G}=\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3,s_1,s_2} V(0) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_2}(k_3) \\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_2-k_3,G}$. We can further simplify $\\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_2-k_3,G}$. Because $k_i$ is momentum inside first Brilloun zone, and the difference between $k_2$ and $k_3$ cannot exceed the first shell of reciprocal lattice vector, which means $G$ can only take the value of the origin point in the reciprocal lattice, therefore, $\\\\sum_{G}\\\\delta_{k_2-k_3,G}=\\\\delta_{k_2-k_3,0}$. Thus, the Hartree term simplifies to $\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3,s_1,s_2} V(0) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_2}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_2-k_3,0}=\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2,s_1,s_2} V(0) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_2}(k_2)$. Therefore, the final simplified Hartree term after reducing one momentum is $\\\\hat{H}^{Hartree}=\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2,s_1,s_2} V(0) \\\\langle c_{s_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{s_1}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{s_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{s_2}(k_2)$ \\n\\nSOLUTION: Following the example, we can simplify the Hartree term $h_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}^{\\\\text{H}}(\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\sigma)$ by reducing the momentum inside the expected value $\\\\langle d_{\\\\alpha,\\\\mathbf{k}_1,\\\\sigma}^{\\\\dagger} d_{\\\\alpha,\\\\mathbf{k}_2,\\\\sigma} \\\\rangle$.  We know that $\\\\langle d_{\\\\alpha,\\\\mathbf{k}_1,\\\\sigma}^{\\\\dagger} d_{\\\\alpha,\\\\mathbf{k}_2,\\\\sigma} \\\\rangle$ is nonzero only when $\\\\mathbf{k}_1=\\\\mathbf{k}_2$, i.e., $\\\\langle d_{\\\\alpha,\\\\mathbf{k}_1,\\\\sigma}^{\\\\dagger} d_{\\\\alpha,\\\\mathbf{k}_2,\\\\sigma} \\\\rangle=\\\\langle d_{\\\\alpha,\\\\mathbf{k}_1,\\\\sigma}^{\\\\dagger} d_{\\\\alpha,\\\\mathbf{k}_2,\\\\sigma} \\\\rangle\\\\delta_{\\\\mathbf{k}_1,\\\\mathbf{k}_2}$.

The potential Hamiltonian has the same degrees of freedom as the kinetic Hamiltonian. The diagonal terms are $\\\\Delta_b(\\\\bm{r})$ and $\\\\Delta_t(\\\\bm{r})$. The off-diagonal terms are the coupling between layer index $l$ and valley index $\\\\tau$, $\\\\Delta_T(\\\\bm{r})$ and $\\\\Delta_T^{\\\\dagger}(\\\\bm{r})$, which should be kept hermitian. All others terms are zero. Express the potential Hamiltonian $H_P$ using $\\\\Delta_b(\\\\bm{r})$ and $\\\\Delta_t(\\\\bm{r})$ and $\\\\Delta_T(\\\\bm{r})$ and $\\\\Delta_T^{\\\\dagger}(\\\\bm{r})$.  Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know): The intralayer and interlayer moir\\\\\\'e potentials are $\\\\Delta_{b/t}=2V\\\\sum_{i=1,3,5}\\\\cos(\\\\bm{G}_i\\\\cdot\\\\bm{r}\\\\pm\\\\phi)$ and $\\\\Delta_T = w(1+e^{-i \\\\bm{G}_2 \\\\cdot \\\\bm{r}} + e^{-i \\\\bm{G}_3 \\\\cdot \\\\bm{r}})$, respectively. $\\\\bm{G}_i = \\\\frac{4\\\\pi}{\\\\sqrt{3} a_M }(\\\\cos\\\\frac{i-1}{3}\\\\pi, \\\\sin\\\\frac{i-1}{3}\\\\pi)$ are moir\\\\\\'e reciprocal lattice vectors with $a_M$ being the moir\\\\\\'e lattice constant. $\\\\bm{\\\\kappa}_+ = 2\\\\bm{G}_1 / 3 - \\\\bm{G}_2 / 3$ and $\\\\bm{\\\\kappa}_- = \\\\bm{G}_1 / 3 + \\\\bm{G}_2 / 3$ are the mBZ corners. $m^*$ is the effective mass and is taken as $0.6 m_e$, where $m_e$ is the free electron mass. Layer-differentiating potential proportional to $\\\\Delta_D$ is included in $H_K$ to take into account the out-of-plane electric field. For $K\\'$ valley, the continuum model Hamiltonian can be deduced by acting time reversal operator on $H_K$. \\n\\nSOLUTION: The potential Hamiltonian $H_P$ in the real space in the single-particle form, given the conventions and the instructions, can be written as:  $$H_P = \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\Delta_{b}(\\\\bm{r}) & 0 & 0 & \\\\Delta_T(\\\\bm{r}) \\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\Delta_{t}(\\\\bm{r}) & \\\\Delta_T^{\\\\dagger}(\\\\bm{r}) & 0 \\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\Delta_T(\\\\bm{r}) & \\\\Delta_{b}(\\\\bm{r}) & 0 \\\\\\\\ \\\\Delta_T^{\\\\dagger}(\\\\bm{r}) & 0 & 0 & \\\\Delta_{t}(\\\\bm{r}) \\\\end{pmatrix}$$  Here, $\\\\Delta_{b}(\\\\bm{r})$ and $\\\\Delta_{t}(\\\\bm{r})$ are the diagonal terms representing the intralayer moiré potentials for the bottom and top layers, respectively. $\\\\Delta_T(\\\\bm{r})$ and $\\\\Delta_T^{\\\\dagger}(\\\\bm{r})$ are the off-diagonal terms representing the interlayer moiré potentials, ensuring the hermiticity of the Hamiltonian.

The degrees of freedom of the system are: spin and sublattice The kinetic term is a tight-binding model composed of the following hopping process: site i and site j with the amplitude $h_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(R_{i}-R_{j})$  The summation should be taken over all spin and sublattice and all real space positions. Return the Kinetic Hamiltonian $H_{0}$.  Use the following conventions for the symbols: $d_{\\\\alpha,i,\\\\sigma}$ is the annihilation operator of an electron with spin σ=↑,↓ on sublattice α of unit cell i, and $h_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(R_{i}-R_{j})$ is the corresponding tight-binding matrix element between sublattices α and β located in unit cells centered at $R_{i}$ and $R_{j}$ respectively. \\n\\nSOLUTION: The kinetic term of the Hamiltonian in the second-quantized form can be written as:  $H_{0} = \\\\sum_{i,j} \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta} \\\\sum_{\\\\sigma} h_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(R_{i}-R_{j}) d_{\\\\alpha,i,\\\\sigma}^{\\\\dagger} d_{\\\\beta,j,\\\\sigma}$  Here, the first sum is over all unit cells i and j, the second sum is over all sublattices α and β, and the third sum is over all spin states σ.

The logic is that the expected value ($\\\\langle{c_{l,\\\\tau,k+q}^\\\\dagger c_{l,\\\\tau,k}}\\\\rangle$) in the first Hartree term ($\\\\langle {c_{l,\\\\tau,k+q}^\\\\dagger c_{l,\\\\tau,k}} \\\\rangle c_{l\\',\\\\tau\\',k\\'-q}^\\\\dagger c_{l,\\\\tau,k\\'} $) has the same form as the quadratic operators in the second Hartree term ($\\\\langle{c_{l\\',\\\\tau\\',k\\'-q}^\\\\dagger c_{l,\\\\tau,k\\'}}\\\\rangle c_{l,\\\\tau,k+q}^\\\\dagger c_{l,\\\\tau,k}$), and vice versa. The same applies to the Fock term. This means, if you relabel the index by swapping the index in the \"expected value\" and \"quadratic operators\" in the second Hartree term, you can make the second Hartree term look identical to the first Hartree term, as long as $V(q)=V(-q)$, which is naturally satisfied in Coulomb interaction. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to simplify it through relabeling the index. You should perform this trick of \"relabeling the index\" for both two Hartree terms and two Fock terms to reduce them to one Hartree term, and one Fock term. You should recall that $H_{\\\\rm int}$ is $H_{\\\\rm int}^{MF} = \\\\frac{1}{2A} \\\\sum_{l,\\\\tau} \\\\sum_{l\\',\\\\tau\\'} \\\\sum_{\\\\bm{k},\\\\bm{k}\\',\\\\bm{q}} V_{ll\\'}(\\\\bm{q}) \\\\left[ \\\\langle c_{l \\\\tau \\\\bm{k}+\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l \\\\tau\\\\bm{k}} \\\\rangle c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\' \\\\bm{k}\\' -\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\' \\\\bm{k}\\'} + \\\\langle c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\' \\\\bm{k}\\' -\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\' \\\\bm{k}\\'} \\\\rangle c_{l \\\\tau \\\\bm{k}+\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l \\\\tau\\\\bm{k}} - \\\\langle c_{l \\\\tau \\\\bm{k}+\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\' \\\\bm{k}\\'} \\\\rangle c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\' \\\\bm{k}\\' -\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l \\\\tau\\\\bm{k}} - \\\\langle c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\' \\\\bm{k}\\' -\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l \\\\tau\\\\bm{k}} \\\\rangle c_{l \\\\tau \\\\bm{k}+\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\' \\\\bm{k}\\'} \\\\right]$. Return the simplified $H_{\\\\rm int}$ which reduces from four terms (two Hartree and two Fock terms) to only two terms (one Hartree and one Fock term)  === EXAMPLE: Given a Hamiltonian $\\\\hat{H}=\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_1-k_4) (\\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) + \\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) ) \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2,k_3+k_4}$, where $V(q)=V(-q)$. In the second term, we relabel the index to swap the index in expected value and the index in quadratic operators, namely, $\\\\sigma_1 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\sigma_2$, $\\\\sigma_3 \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\sigma_4$, $k_1 \\\\leftrightarrow k_2$, $k_3 \\\\leftrightarrow k_4$. After the replacement, the second term becomes $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_2-k_3) \\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. Note that the Kronecker dirac function $\\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$ implies $k_1+k_2=k_3+k_4$, i.e., $k_2-k_3=k_4-k_1$. Thus, the second term simplifies to $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_4-k_1) \\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. Because $V(q)=V(-q)$, meaning $V(k_4-k_1)=V(k_1-k_4)$, the second term further simplifies to $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_1-k_4) \\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. Note that this form of second term after relabeling is identical to the first term. Finally, we have the simplified Hamiltonian as  $\\\\hat{H}=2\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,\\\\sigma_1,\\\\sigma_2,\\\\sigma_3,\\\\sigma_4} V(k_1-k_4) \\\\langle c_{\\\\sigma_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{\\\\sigma_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{\\\\sigma_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{\\\\sigma_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_4+k_3,k_2+k_1}$. \\n\\nSOLUTION: To simplify the quadratic term $H_{\\\\rm int}$, we can relabel the indices in the second Hartree term and the second Fock term.  For the second Hartree term, we swap the indices as follows: $l \\\\leftrightarrow l\\'$, $\\\\tau \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\tau\\'$, $\\\\bm{k} \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\bm{k}\\'$, and $\\\\bm{q} \\\\rightarrow -\\\\bm{q}$. After the replacement, the second Hartree term becomes:  $$\\\\langle c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\' \\\\bm{k}\\'+\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\'\\\\bm{k}\\'} \\\\rangle c_{l \\\\tau \\\\bm{k} -\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l \\\\tau\\\\bm{k}}$$  Since $V_{ll\\'}(\\\\bm{q}) = V_{ll\\'}(-\\\\bm{q})$ due to the nature of the Coulomb interaction, the second Hartree term simplifies to:  $$V_{ll\\'}(\\\\bm{q}) \\\\langle c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\' \\\\bm{k}\\'+\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\'\\\\bm{k}\\'} \\\\rangle c_{l \\\\tau \\\\bm{k} -\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l \\\\tau\\\\bm{k}}$$  which is identical to the first Hartree term.  For the second Fock term, we swap the indices as follows: $l \\\\leftrightarrow l\\'$, $\\\\tau \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\tau\\'$, $\\\\bm{k} \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\bm{k}\\'$, and $\\\\bm{q} \\\\rightarrow -\\\\bm{q}$. After the replacement, the second Fock term becomes:  $$\\\\langle c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\' \\\\bm{k}\\'+\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l \\\\tau\\\\bm{k}} \\\\rangle c_{l \\\\tau \\\\bm{k} -\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\' \\\\bm{k}\\'}$$  Again, since $V_{ll\\'}(\\\\bm{q}) = V_{ll\\'}(-\\\\bm{q})$, the second Fock term simplifies to:  $$V_{ll\\'}(\\\\bm{q}) \\\\langle c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\' \\\\bm{k}\\'+\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l \\\\tau\\\\bm{k}} \\\\rangle c_{l \\\\tau \\\\bm{k} -\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\' \\\\bm{k}\\'}$$  which is identical to the first Fock term.  Therefore, the simplified $H_{\\\\rm int}$ reduces from four terms to only two terms:  $$H_{\\\\rm int}^{MF} = \\\\frac{1}{A} \\\\sum_{l,\\\\tau} \\\\sum_{l\\',\\\\tau\\'} \\\\sum_{\\\\bm{k},\\\\bm{k}\\',\\\\bm{q}} V_{ll\\'}(\\\\bm{q}) \\\\left[ \\\\langle c_{l \\\\tau \\\\bm{k}+\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l \\\\tau\\\\bm{k}} \\\\rangle c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\' \\\\bm{k}\\' -\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\' \\\\bm{k}\\'} - \\\\langle c_{l \\\\tau \\\\bm{k}+\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\' \\\\bm{k}\\'} \\\\rangle c_{l\\' \\\\tau\\' \\\\bm{k}\\' -\\\\bm{q}}^{\\\\dagger} c_{l \\\\tau\\\\bm{k}} \\\\right]$$\\n\\nSCORE: '}]\n"

Return $H_{\\\\text{quadratic}}$.  Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know): $t_{s}\\\\left(\\\\bm{R}_i-\\\\bm{R}_j\\\\right)$ is the hopping between the moir\\\\'e lattice site $i$ and $j$, fitted from the first moir\\\\'e valence band of twisted WSe$_2$ at $\\\\pm K$ valleys in the noninteracting picture, and $s=\\\\uparrow$ and $ \\\\downarrow$ are coupled with the $+K$ and $-K$ valleys. $U(\\\\bm{R}_i-\\\\bm{R}_j)$ describes the Coulomb repulsion between site $i$ and $j$. \",\n          \"You will be instructed to simplify the Hartree term in $H_{\\\\text{Hartree}}$ by reducing the momentum inside the expected value $\\\\langle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q,s}\\\\rangle$. The expected value $\\\\langle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q,s}\\\\rangle$ is only nonzero when the two momenta $k_i,k_j$ are the same, namely, $\\\\langle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q,s}\\\\rangle=\\\\langle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q,s}\\\\rangle \\\\delta_{k,q}$. You should use the property of Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta_{k_i,k_j}$ to reduce one momentum $k_i$ but not $b_i$. Once you reduce one momentum inside the expected value $\\\\langle\\\\dots\\\\rangle$. You will also notice the total momentum conservation will reduce another momentum in the quadratic term. Therefore, you should end up with only two momenta left in the summation. You should follow the EXAMPLE below to reduce one momentum in the Hartree term, and another momentum in the quadratic term. You should recall that $H_{\\\\text{Hartree}}$ is $H_{\\\\text{Hartree}} = \\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{s,s'}\\\\sum_{k,k',q,q'} U(k-q) \\\\langle c_{k,s}^\\\\dagger c_{q,s}\\\\rangle c_{k',s'}^\\\\dagger c_{q',s'}   \\\\sum_{G} \\\\delta(k-q+k'-q',G)$.. Return the final simplified Hartree term $H_{\\\\text{Hartree}}$.  === EXAMPLE: Given a Hamiltonian where the Hartree term $\\\\hat{H}^{Hartree}=\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+k_4+b_3+b_4}$, where $k_i$ is the momentum inside first Brilloun zone and $b_i$ is the reciprocal lattice. Inside the expected value, we realize $\\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle$ is nonzero only when $k_1=k_4$, i.e., $\\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle=\\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle\\\\delta_{k_1,k_4}$. Thus, the Hartree term becomes $\\\\sum_{k_1,k_2, k_3, k_4,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_4+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_4) \\\\rangle \\\\delta_{k_1,k_4} c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+k_4+b_3+b_4}$. Use the property of Kronecker delta function $\\\\delta_{k_1,k_4}$ to sum over $k_4$, we have $\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(k_1-k_1+b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_1+k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+k_1+b_3+b_4}=\\\\sum_{k_1, k_2, k_3,b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4} V(b_1-b_4) \\\\langle c_{b_1}^\\\\dagger(k_1) c_{b_4}(k_1) \\\\rangle c_{b_2}^\\\\dagger(k_2) c_{b_3}(k_3) \\\\delta_{k_2+b_1+b_2,k_3+b_3+b_4}$.

You should recall that $\\\\mathcal{H}_{\\\\text{C}}$ is $\\\\mathcal{H}_{\\\\text{C}} = \\\\frac{1}{2N} \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta} \\\\sum_{\\\\sigma,\\\\sigma'} \\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{k}_1,\\\\mathbf{k}_2,\\\\mathbf{k}_3,\\\\mathbf{k}_4} V_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(\\\\mathbf{k}_1 - \\\\mathbf{k}_2) d_{\\\\alpha,\\\\mathbf{k}_1,\\\\sigma}^{\\\\dagger} d_{\\\\alpha,\\\\mathbf{k}_2,\\\\sigma} d_{\\\\beta,\\\\mathbf{k}_3,\\\\sigma'}^{\\\\dagger} d_{\\\\beta,\\\\mathbf{k}_4,\\\\sigma'} \\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{G}} \\\\delta(\\\\mathbf{k}_1-\\\\mathbf{k}_2+\\\\mathbf{k}_3-\\\\mathbf{k}_4,\\\\mathbf{G})$. Return the expanded interaction term after Hartree-Fock approximation as $\\\\mathcal{H}_{\\\\text{HF}}$.  Use the following conventions for the symbols (You should also obey the conventions in all my previous prompts if you encounter undefined symbols. If you find it is never defined or has conflicts in the conventions, you should stop and let me know): $\\\\mathcal{H}_{\\\\text{HF}}$ is the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian, $\\\\bar{h}_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\sigma)$ is the renormalized matrix elements due to both Hartree and Fock contributions, $\\\\rho_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\sigma)$ is the zero-temperature density matrix for a given momentum and spin, and $\\\\phi_{\\\\alpha,\\\\mathbf{k}}^{(n)}(\\\\sigma)$ are the exact eigenvectors of $\\\\mathcal{H}_{\\\\text{HF}}$. $\\\\rho_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\sigma)=\\\\sum_{n}^{\\\\text{occupied}}\\\\phi_{\\\\alpha,\\\\mathbf{k}}^{(n)}(\\\\sigma)\\\\phi_{\\\\beta,\\\\mathbf{k}}^{(n)*}(\\\\sigma)$   === EXAMPLE 1: For a four-fermion term $a_1^\\\\dagger a_2^\\\\dagger a_3 a_4$, using Wick's theorem and preserving only the normal terms. this is expanded as $a_1^\\\\dagger a_2^\\\\dagger a_3 a_4 = \\\\langle a_1^\\\\dagger a_4 \\\\rangle a_2^\\\\dagger a_3 + \\\\langle a_2^\\\\dagger a_3 \\\\rangle a_1^\\\\dagger a_4 - \\\\langle a_1^\\\\dagger a_4 \\\\rangle \\\\langle a_2^\\\\dagger a_3\\\\rangle - \\\\langle a_1^\\\\dagger a_3 \\\\rangle a_2^\\\\dagger a_4 - \\\\langle a_2^\\\\dagger a_4 \\\\rangle a_1^\\\\dagger a_3 + \\\\langle a_1^\\\\dagger a_3\\\\rangle \\\\langle a_2^\\\\dagger a_4 \\\\rangle$ Be cautious about the order of the index and sign before each term here.  EXAMPLE 2: For a four-fermion term $a_1^\\\\dagger a_2 a_3^\\\\dagger a_4$, using Wick's theorem and preserving only the normal terms. this is expanded as $a_1^\\\\dagger a_2 a_3^\\\\dagger a_4 = \\\\langle a_1^\\\\dagger a_2 \\\\rangle a_3^\\\\dagger a_4 + \\\\langle a_3^\\\\dagger a_4 \\\\rangle a_1^\\\\dagger a_2 - \\\\langle a_1^\\\\dagger a_2 \\\\rangle \\\\langle a_3^\\\\dagger a_4\\\\rangle - \\\\langle a_1^\\\\dagger a_4 \\\\rangle a_3^\\\\dagger a_2 - \\\\langle a_3^\\\\dagger a_2 \\\\rangle a_1^\\\\dagger a_4 + \\\\langle a_1^\\\\dagger a_4\\\\rangle \\\\langle a_3^\\\\dagger a_2 \\\\rangle$ Be cautious about the order of the index and sign before each term here. \\n\\nSOLUTION: Applying Wick's theorem to the interaction term $\\\\mathcal{H}_{\\\\text{C}}$ and preserving only the normal terms, we can expand the four-fermion term as follows:  $\\\\mathcal{H}_{\\\\text{C}} = \\\\frac{1}{2N} \\\\sum_{\\\\alpha,\\\\beta} \\\\sum_{\\\\sigma,\\\\sigma'} \\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{k}_1,\\\\mathbf{k}_2,\\\\mathbf{k}_3,\\\\mathbf{k}_4} V_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta}(\\\\mathbf{k}_1 -
