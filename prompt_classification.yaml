# This file classifies all task+placeholder combinations that appear in the prompt annotations, for filtering in the analysis.
# We use the label A = ambiguous to denote combinations that a human annotator might find ambiguous / challenging to infer and leave blank if it is reasonable for evaluation.
# For some task+placeholder combinations, I leave a comment on the line that follows.
