You are a condensed matter physicist working on the numerical calculation for the Hamiltonian of a system using the Hartree Fock method. I will provide you with the physical Hamitonian written in second quantized form as an equation in LaTeX. You should convert it into a class for the HartreeFockHamiltonian using Python and necessary packages, such as numpy and scipy.
This is a multiple-step problem, and you will execute this process by analyzing the equation and answering smaller questions sequentially in order to finally generate the class. The class has the following structure:

The INPUT provided to you is the equation for the Hamiltonian, `HAMILTONIAN EQUATION`.

QUESTION 1: Dimension and Basis Order: The Hamiltonian will have the shape [D, D, Nk], where D is a tuple that accounts for all the flavors in the system, and Nk is the number of k points on the lattice. A 'flavor' is an identifier that distinguishes particles from each other. It can be the spin, level, orbital, or reciprocal lattice vector.
For example D could look like: (|spin|, |orbital_flavor|) or (|spin|, |level|, |reciprocal_lattice_vector|) for continuum models, where |level| is the number of orbital flavors. Use the terms in the equation to infer D, needed to account for all interactions.

The convention you must follow is the following:
If you are in the hole basis, the first tuple indices qualify the annihilation operator (denoted by the absence of the $^\dagger$) and the second set qualify the creation operator (denoted by the $^\dagger$ symbols) as below:
H[s1, l1, q1, s2, l2, q2, :] -> c_{s1, l1, q1}, c_^$\dagger$_{s2, l2, q2}

If you are in the particle basis, the first tuple indices qualify the creation operator and the second set the annihilation operator as below:
H[s1, l1, q1, s2, l2, q2, :] -> c^$\dagger$_{s1, l1, q1}, c_{s2, l2, q2}

Remember, a term of the form \langle c_{k^\prime,\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{k^\prime,\uparrow} \rangle c_{k,\downarrow}^{\dagger} c_{k,\downarrow} corresponds to a down-down interaction, i.e. you must ignore the interactions INSIDE an expectation when assessing what interaction a term corresponds to.

Your reply should be of the form:
`Tuple of Flavors (D) = (|flavor_0|, |flavor_1|, ...)`
`Basis Order:
0: <flavor type 0>. Order: <flavor_00>, <flavor_01>...
1: <flavor type 1>. Order: <flavor_10>, <flavor_11>...
...

QUESTION 2: Identifying Interacting Terms:
`exp_val` is always an input to `generate_Htotal`. This is the expectation value that is updated every iteration and is a matrix with (D_flattened, D_flattened, N_k) where D_flattened, is the product of the tuple of flavors and N_k is total number of k points on the lattice. The first line in the `generate_interating` function unsqueezes (expands) `exp_val` so it has the same shape as the Hamiltonian i.e. (D, D, N_k).
Identify `EXP-VAL DEPENDENT TERMS` in the Equation. This should be a dictionary of the form:
`EXP-VAL DEPENDENT TERMS`: `expression_i`: function of `exp_val`.
Now for all terms in the Hamiltonian, identify which terms are interacting and which are non-interacting, as well as which matrix element they belong to, using the Basis Order you defined above.
Only `generate_interacting` depends on `exp_val`. You should use the description of the Hamiltonian to infer which terms contribute to the interacting part of the Hamiltonian: interacting terms include both 1) ALL terms dependent on `EXP-VAL DEPENDENT TERMS` and 2) all terms that depend on parameters that describe interaction strengths.
Non-Interacting terms do NOT depend on `exp_val`. All the variables that depend on EXP-VAL DEPENDENT TERMS, should be recomputed inside `generate_interacting` since `exp_val` is updated every iteration.

QUESTION 3: You will now complete the class for the HartreeFock Hamiltonian. You will modify only the HartreeFockHamiltonian class functions. The comments with `LM Task` demarcate where changes need to be made.
The following functions are already predefined and do not need to be modified or redefined: `generate_k_space`. Annotate the code with comments so it is evident which interaction each element in the matrix accounts for. Modify the `init` function so `parameter_kwargs` is replaced with all constants and parameters that do NOT appear in EXP-VAL DEPENDENT TERMS.
These should be accessible from `generate_Htotal` via self.<parameter_name>. Make sure the `init` and `generate_Htotal` functions are consistent. Assign default values to these parameters, so that the class can be initialized as `HartreeFockHamiltonian()`, without requiring user inputs. Assume the temperature (T) of the system is 0.

QUESTION 4: You are also provided with the LATTICE, which corresponds to the `self.lattice` attribute in the class.

Learn how to generate and format your answers from the following example:
EXAMPLE 0:
HAMILTONIAN EQUATION: The problem of interest is a Hubbard model on a 2d square lattice.  The Hartree-Fock mean field Hamiltonian is $H^{HF}=H_{0}+H_{int}^{HF}$
where the noninteracting part is $H_0= \sum_k \epsilon_{k,\uparrow} c_{k,\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{k,\uparrow} + \sum_k \epsilon_{k,\downarrow} c_{k,\downarrow}^{\dagger} c_{k,\downarrow}$  and $\epsilon_{k,\uparrow}=\epsilon_{k,\downarrow}=-2t (\cos(k_x)+\cos(k_y))$
and interacting part after Wick theorem expansion is $H_{int}^{HF}=U\sum_{k} (\sum_{k'}1/N \langle c_{k^\prime,\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{k^\prime,\uparrow} \rangle c_{k,\downarrow}^{\dagger} c_{k,\downarrow}  + \sum_{k'}1/N \langle c_{k^\prime,\downarrow}^{\dagger} c_{k^\prime,\downarrow} \rangle c_{k,\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{k,\uparrow} )  $

Now generate the code, following the same format as the example, for the following Hamiltonian:
HAMILTONIAN EQUATION: 
$E_s(k)=\sum_{n} t_s(n) e^{-i k \cdot n}$
$\hat{H}_{Kinetic} = \sum_{s, k} E_s(k) c^\dagger_s(k)  c_s(k)$, where $E_s(k)=\sum_{n} t_s(n) e^{-i k \cdot n}$
$H_{\text{Hartree}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{s, s'} \sum_{k_1, k_2} U(0) \langle c_s^\dagger(k_1) c_s(k_1) \rangle c_{s'}^\dagger(k_2) c_{s'}(k_2)$
$H_{\text{Fock}} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{s, s'} \sum_{k_1, k_2} U(k_1 - k_2) \langle c_s^\dagger(k_1) c_{s'}(k_1) \rangle c_{s'}^\dagger(k_2) c_s(k_2)$
$U(k) = \sum_{n} U(n) e^{-i k \cdot n}$, where U_0 is the on-site interaction, U_1 is the nearest neighbor interaction, and U_k is the k-th shell neighbor interaction. Here, we consider only the on-site interaction and the nearest neighbor interaction.
Hopping parameters are t_1 = 6 meV for nearest-neighbor hopping and t_2 = 1 meV for next-nearest-neighbor hopping.
