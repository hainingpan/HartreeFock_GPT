You need to analyze the band structure plots with particular attention to symmetry:

1. First, identify the shape of the Brillouin zone boundary and confirm it matches what's expected for a {lattice} lattice.
2. Next, examine the symmetry of the energy distribution shown by the false color plot:
    2.1 Identify the highest energy regions (yellow)
    2.2 Trace the pattern of energy variation across the zone
    2.3 Determine what rotational and mirror symmetries are present in this energy distribution
    2.4 Is the "symmetry of the zone boundary" the subgroup of the "symmetry of the energy pattern"? Namely, the "symmetry of the energy pattern" should not contain less symmetries than the "symmetry of the zone boundary".

3. Compare the symmetry you observe in the energy distribution with what would be expected for an isotropic {lattice} lattice.
4. Based on your analysis, determine whether the band structure displays the full symmetry of the {lattice} lattice or a reduced symmetry.
