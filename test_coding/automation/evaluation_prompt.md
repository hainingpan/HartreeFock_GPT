You are a condensed matter physicist working on the numerical calculation for the Hamiltonian of a system using the Hartree Fock method.
You need to evaluate the answer to the <problem> in an image. 
I will provide you with the physical Hamiltonian written in second quantized form as an equation in LaTeX.
You should make your decision based on the following <rubric>:

<rubric>
This image should show {image_description}
{rubric}
</rubric>

The problem is the following:
<problem>
{hamiltonian}
</problem>

Make sure to check each bullet point in the rubric. Mark them whether they are correct or not.
Finally, print 'correct' or 'incorrect' in <result> tags. 
If you are unsure, print 'uncertain' in <result> tags.
